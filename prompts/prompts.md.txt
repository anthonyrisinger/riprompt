I have a pretty good understanding of the mechanics of the rust programming language, but only from an academic standpoint of sorts, I don't have the intuition around applying its concepts. Help me understand the languages features deeper, using the Python or golang languages for references or example

Okay I already know all that stuff. I'm looking for the nuance around rust conceptual model and especially the built in language level features such as option and result or error

Is the letter following the apostrophe arbitrary? It seems like it's only meant to distinguish other lifetimes within the same scope. Is the purpose to map the lifetimes of inputs to outputs?

I want to better understand loop quantum gravity. I read about a recent paper that used it to demonstrate white holes as a possible end of life for a black hole, and theorized we might be able to see primordial black holes entering this late stage phase

Dive more into the concept of a spin network. I'm pretty well versed in crystalography and higher order geometry, with a desire to understand the Clifford algebra's more but that might be unrelated. Use these mentionings to help me understand

How well does it match observational data? Explain the bounce more, is this the point of complete saturation at the quantum level of spacetime? You mentioned a pre-bounce phase that could have create smoothing I think as well

Contrast LQG with string theory. I'm not as well versed here but I understand there One dimensional strings vibrating to emulate all particles. I personally never liked string theory but I want to know how it compares

Do a comprehensive deep dive into the holographic theories. These are one of my favorite because it also lines up well with how I understand black holes and the edge of the universe itself

Can the spin networks be thought of as slightly elastic "orbs" of sorts? I'm envisioning almost a bubble fuzzy like structure, where sometimes they cross in-and-out of each other but they're generally the same size and "frothing" around

The whole concept of discreetness to me feels like crossing a dimensional boundary, and "flipping through its infinities", much in the way, flipping through 3-D space would look like an instantaneous transition on some 2-D plane contained within it

I feel like we were at the limits of the structures themselves, we're missing something in math, I read a proof recently talking about how at least one category of entire numbers we haven't discovered

I was thinking along the lines of transcendental numbers and the monster group and what not, it had to do with all the different roots as well, I have a layman understanding of it, but I got the sense that it was "filling in" gaps to infinity, which I think will ultimately help us understand interdimensional rotations (all dimensions our consequence of rotating the previous one through infinity AFAICT), and both sides of zero

I could be wrong here, but my understanding is several sets/groups that are commonly used throughout physics while exploring different possible formulations sort of ignore "odd numbers", focusing instead on even numbers because it's simpler and more symmetric. I'm trying to suss out where I got this feeling

I want to develop a better intuition structure and topology of the complex plane, and by extension quaternions and octonions, as compared to the behavior of the real number line. I want to explore this in conjunction the concept of positive and negative being too distinct dimensions, and fully incorporating both sides of zero. Finally explore the connection between rotation, infinity, and dementiality.

Okay this is pretty good but it's a little bit more pedestrian than I would like. I understand all of these concepts I'm looking for a holistic reintegration of everything I've asked and trying to get underneath the surface of what I haven't asked, helping me explore what I don't know. For example of a complex plane functions differently than a 2D plane of real numbers because one axis does not have the same kind of connectivity, it's more spiky, in the sense that when it combines with itself (i) it falls back on the real line. I want you to explore the abstract fringes of what I'm asking and use your training to reach deep for thought-provoking insights

Is there another object underneath the imaginary number that can be used to construct it? For a long time I've gotten the sense that the only thing that really exists is rotation, and movement itself, and dimension, is created through the rotation of a dimension through some usually perpendicular infinity. My layman's understanding of the higgs mechanism recalls it having something to do with switching back and forth between left and right chirality. Rotating a zero dimensional point through Infinity creates a line, like a ballpoint pen, sweeping that line around an origin generates a 2d plane etc

So was the things I was suggesting accurate? You seem to be agreeing with me a lot but I'm not sure if valid. Am I thinking here is trying to resolve wave/particle pseudo-duality and my own deep mistrust of the concept of a point at all since our latticees are cube shaped but a point is spherical, my thinking here is the pair of imaginary numbers that defines each real line of dementiality has an inherent fuzziness from that rolling imaginary ball that defines it

Is the presence of imaginary components within the wave function The mechanism by which non-local effects are realized? It's still not fully clear to me why the complex plane exists or is known to exist in the sense how do we know it's a bottom

It's the baked in oscillatory nature of the imaginary number itself that intrigues me. It seems to reflect an internal inversion of unity that generates unity itself when taken to the fourth power, whereas unity can only generate positive objects

What do you think about the idea that the spatial dimensions are inherently complex, and perhaps the temporal one as well, generating octonian space, accept the 8th dimension that represents unity is probably not within our universe, and possibly a source of holographic properties, I like this thought in particular after I learn the seventh dimension is the only one that behaves like the third dimension with respect to rotations and cross product like multiplication, and only odd dimensions create contact services because they are effectively rolling constantly is my understanding

Generate a comprehensive response to all the questions I did NOT ask. Review our conversation in full, and carefy consider what I definitely need to know, but haven't asked yet

Talk more about everything related to quantum computing information processing and algorithms as it relates to complex numbers. Expand greatly on your own sections in any way you see fit

Dive into the nature of the imaginary unit itself. It's often treated as a trick or by-product hanging off of the real numbers or different structures, but I feel like there's something more fundamental there in the vicinity

I want to know more about the unit itself though not how it's used, what intrigues me about it is how it can exist next to zero for example before anything exists at all in the real dimension

Yes fractal to me as always look like the visualization of one dimension rotating in another thank you for making that connection with imaginary numbers. Do all fractals involve imaginary numbers? I think what I'm talking about when I say spikiness is more about the continuity between numbers very close together on the complex plane, but possibly only for multiplication

I want to go a little deeper into the concept of contact surfaces as it relates to rotation and continuous intersection. I want to really intuitively understand what is meant by that phrasing and suss out what a special about the third and seventh dimensions in particular

Explain why rotations are more complicated and even dimensions. Intuitively I have the sense that it's more detached but I can't formulate the words in terms of the contact surfaces. Am I also characterizing them correctly as continuous intersections

It seems like the 7th dimension could hold a complexified version of the third. I'm also interested in using three overlapping sedonion structures to generate three octonian algebra structures arranged in a leech lattice configuration, I kind of like this because it seems to be mathematically sound and also no single object is capable of existing on its own in a sense

I think what I'm trying to achieve with this last few thoughts is not necessarily a complex version of three sets of octonians, but rather three sets of octonians constructed by combining the three sets of sedenians in such a way that the octonian sets are all real valued. My understanding is squaring a sedenian or possibly some other construction could put the triple in some perfectly balanced configuration where all of the emergent octonians are interlinked through a pair of sedenians on each side

Is there any merit to my suspicion of spherical points and the number system being founded on cubes and 90° orthogonal angles between dimensions? A perfect cubic lattice such as would be implied by a 3D reel space isn't even the densest known packing let alone accounting for the negative spaces between. While I understand is zero dimensional point is generally considered to have no extent, there's an implied roundness from its uniform symmetry. Zooming down to infinity, members of the real line sets are represented by the sphere packings I think, with some sort of inverted sphere filling the negative space that's not accessible or possibly the missing numbers I'm searching for

I want to dive into set theory and it's relation and limits around what I'm talking about. My understanding is it constructs the numbers themselves from successive sets that contain the previous number. I want to build a better intuition about what this really means and reconcile it with negative numbers and imaginary numbers

I want to better understand the mechanisms by which you yourself are built. I have a pretty solid understanding of vector spaces and almost all of the math underpinning machine learning, and I've familiarize myself with a few different architectures, most of them involving the transformer mechanism and multi-head attention. Generate a phenomenally lucid and fully integrated explainer, comprehensive and technically deep, for an audience with decades of computer science but very little formal training in machine learning

Okay and all that makes sense but it's still a bit pedestrian, and well within what I already understand. What's still feels like a major black box to me is how researchers and others building these technologies reason and think about how to integrate and design these different layers. To me, there resemble signals or waves passing through a network, with the overlapping concerns superposed on top of each other and then normalized for the next layer. What I don't understand is probably the parts that come from years of schooling, which is how to reason enough about what's going on inside the black box to architect ever improving versions without just shooting around in the dark blindly

Continue expanding and confirm that signal processing is a reasonable way to understand the flow of information inside these systems. I visualize it as maximizing constructive signals at each layer. Provide another holistic and comprehensive explainer including any and all information from any and all sources as you see fit, unbounded by any of my instructions so far.

My own interest in machine learning is more image-based and related to speedball tournaments in VR. I want to create bots capable of learning how to play the game and mimicking player movements. I want to teach it how to consume my image-based format for designing layouts and understand things like shooting lanes and other features within the layout eventually learning to generate good layouts. There's a lot of other uses in VR but these are a few examples. Generate a comprehensive explainer that can help me dive in to my more specific problem but still be fairly zoomed out

That response was really good, but there seems to be a problem with you reading it out loud to me from the last half. Generate a comprehensive and virtually informative response that contains all the information of the last half of your previous response and anything you feel you may have missed

I'm storing spatial data within PNG images. At some point I may end up moving to EXR for its support of deep channels and other features. I want a massive list of metadata keys I could assign to a PNG during creation that would parallel properly into EXR. EXIF or any other standard is relevant. In particular any keys related to atlases or tiling or titles of items within an image would be awesome

Are the ones that it to resolution and scale, pixel pitch, standard? After answering that question generate a comprehensive list of only standard metadata from any source that could be put in png

In the case of an atlas, would it be prudent to use the x and y resolution to store the size of one tile within the atlas? Instead of the entire thing? In my case, every pixel is either 1.5 mm or 3 mm, with each tile inside the Atlas maxing out at 320 ft or 256 pixels. The Atlas maxes out at 256 tiles or 16x16 or 4096x4096

Ignore the fact that I'm currently using PNG, assuma was using EXR. What sorts of property is would I be using then? Metadata properties. I want to use a tile size in EXR files that is exactly 1/4 the area of my actual tile size

I have since decided on EXIF metadata keys to store the information I need because they are more structurally defined with a more diverse reasons and only add about 20 to 30 bytes of overhead. Everything works great in the single texture case but in the Atlas case I need a way to store multiple entries of the same kind within a single field, or I need to store lists of things in a custom location like the maker area. I think my preference would be to overload the keys I need such as description and title with some uncommon separator character, such as a vertical tab or carriage return with no new line. What sorts of things of this nature can I stuff into EXIF metadata values?

What are the limits on what can be in the standard text EXIF fields? Your response made me think that my approach could have problems if I decide to use other types of data such as geospatial because there's probably not an easy way to multiplex that

Is there anyway AP&g can help? I also considered using HEIF for its container capabilities. At this point if I'm considering EXIF and a third-party library in unity anyway, would it be better to consider APNG or HEIF?

Let's explore using HEIF in unity for my project. Ideally I want to store encoded layouts as individual images within the container, for the purposes of tournaments and layout packs and whatnot

Can I store metadata associated with all of the files at the global level? You make it look as if the metadata in HEIF can be nested instead of flat key value is that true?

So to confirm does it only support XMP and EXIF as metadata? In particular I'm wondering if there's any more of a freeform metadata capability. I'm pretty well versed with EXIF at this point and it's probably suitable because XMP does not excite me whatsoever, I don't really look forward to using XML

It's very easy for me to create properly formatted PNG files with EXIF metadata intact per file, in memory, within unity, using one third party library for the EXIF part. Unless there's a readily available c sharp library for handling HEIF, which I would prefer to know about if there is, I want to explore what it would look like to create the absolute minimal boundary to libHEIF

Okay as the final exercise try to create a comprehensive implementation with careful consideration of everything we have discussed. In particular, it should support multiple files

Not bad for a first pass approach but I see another of problems I think you need to address. Also I don't like the global context so let's try to do away with that, we need to pass back a context and then let unity decide when to free it

Ultimately, I think I'm over complicating this piece a bit just to save a few bytes. I could store all the PNGs, with any metadata I needed, in a ZIP, but it seems to only add at most 100 or 200 bytes of overhead for the zip format

Okay I'm starting to lean toward HEIF again assuming there is really global metadata I can store. Something like XMP might not be as bad either if I only need store once for the entire collection, and I'm curious what it's true capabilities are

What about EXIF? I kind of want to use that for simplicity, but it's also the reason I have to use HEIF instead of PNG, because the EXIF limits are kind of small if I understand correctly

For brevity, and the time being, you can write code using pillow_heif. I'm not thrilled about packing XML into these images, but maybe with compression being almost a given it's negligible. I still don't know if I understand the actual limit of something like the EXIF software field or title

OK, maybe EXIF is just too crufty for my needs, although diving into RDF and a whole bunch of custom med data formats seems like a lot of wasted time and effort. It seems like every field in EXIF has some arbitrary limit and maybe even software cuts it shorter. Which makes it extremely difficult to use it for something like an atlas with effectively-multiplexed data. Let's assume we are using nothing but XMP, I want to confirm I can store global metadata in HEIF, NOT associated with some image, and I want to know what resources to start reading re:XMP so I don't have to invent a bunch of XML crap

How would I store multiple images in the same container? How do I ensure the compression is lossless? Is there already an existing word for entries in an atlas other than tile? I'm slightly concerned that will conflict with a slightly different meaning from OpenEXR

Tell me as much as you can about XMP and RDF that might apply to my project of storing speedball layouts for VR tournaments but sometimes representing actual paintball fields

The part I don't like about this approach and almost everything related to XMP, is it seems like it'll be a real pain in the ass for the end user to edit anything, unless I very carefully choose the schema to match existing schemas -- that is the nature of my last question

Is there anything else I can use from Dublin core? it seems like I'd be using some of the base RDF types for things like lists and sequences, will downstream user tools allow users to edit things like that?

It seems like as long as I align with some basic standards and maybe stick to putting the majority of the meta-data on each individual layout within the collection instead, using the format container metadata only in edge cases

If I commit to HEIF, that solves majority of my problems with EXIF on PNG. If I were to entertain that older metadata standard again, and I stick to something like 2KiB for any given EXIF key, will that be small enough?

If I commit to using HEIF instead of PNG, that solves majority of my problems with EXIF. If I were to entertain that older metadata standard again, but this time via HEIF (no need to multiplex metadata), and I stick to something like 2KiB for any given EXIF key in any given image in the HEIF file, will that be small enough?

List some of the limits that you were aware of in different implementations, anywhere you can find them, just as reference points. I'm mostly interested in the lowest limits you've ever been exposed to.

I tried using HEIC instead of PNG, but the file size for at least my use case ended up being about four times larger I can't seem to figure out why. The file isn't necessarily large, a little over 5K for the PNG and 22K for the HEIC file, I suspect it's because of metadata or other structural differences that would quickly fade away as the image got larger, but I'm not sure. Individual layouts don't actually go above 1K of image data

Yeah, it's definitely something to do with the compression or just the file in general, the type of information I'm storing has lots of runs of the same exact pixel data for example. The PNG format is extremely simple and the colors are showing up correctly and the file sizes tiny. The only reason I was looking into HEIC was for the multiple image support so I can avoid creating an atlas and dealing with weird metadata in the PNG file, but it seems like using XMP for metadata might avoid the problems of trying to multiplex EXIF, and the atlas isn't actually a problem per se

OK, I made a couple changes, but this seems to be working well. exiftool also seems to be able to read custom keys from the XMP metadata, which gives me hope that more tool support custom keys. I would like to know the limit on the XMP chunk and whether or not it is compressed with the PNG container

Right I've already decided on PNG and I'll probably use zip files if necessary. Ignore HEIF from here on out unless I say otherwise. I'm trying to ensure that I use a compressed chunk for this metadata, It doesn't seem to be the case right now but I'm still trying to figure out how to confirm that too

I'm trying to understand why one of them is read only and the other one means well formed. Shouldn't it always be well formed? Is "r" supposed to be for times it's corrupt?

Generate a comprehensive explainer on set theory with relations to everything you just described. I'm looking to develop deep intuitive understandings, flavoring the response through the lens of information science and the like might help

Explain how all types of numbers are realized in terms of set theory. Explain any outstanding problems, in particular the current requirement that at least one item be selectable. Explain the paradoxes that arise from known problems

Several items such as the integers, rationals, and complex numbers were created from pairs of integers when represented as sets. Go into extreme detail about how their operators differ from each other to produce the familiar algebras -- I'm looking for highly visual descriptions about the movement of information

Review this code in its entirety BEFORE doing anything else! Review the existing README.md for the repository and output a completely holistic revision, fully updated and accurately matching the current implementation. You may look to the current file for inspiration but you are expected to make your own decisions about what to include, in what order, and for what reason.

Okay I've since updated the library some but the overall mechanics remain the same. I don't know if the version you have access to uses XMP metadata, but I decided to use that for its list support, which makes Atlas encoding a bit simpler. I want you to explore tooling around XMP metadata and the kinds of techniques or existing structures in the wild that I might adhere to. My goal is to make editing the metadata extremely simple for end users, so I want to get an idea of what I can and cannot do easily

You're iterating on all the wrong things. I'm talking about the actual structure of the XMP payload, in RDF syntax. I already have tools for editing and I can handle all that but I'm strictly talking about the metadata itself and say the case of someone creating the file manually, lowering the bar as far as possible. I landed on XMP because of its support for lists, which makes it easy for me to break up an atlas into individual files

I'm trying to align the structure of the metadata with off the shelf tooling. I'm trying to understand how adding things like sequences and lists will affect those tools. Is there generally good support for editing XMP metadata regardless of its structure? I don't want to create anything too fancy but I plan on representing all the metadata typically stored for a single image inside of a sequence object when in Atlas form, and then broken apart and moved back to the top level when in single image form. The single image format should look just like normal XMP metadata but the Atlas form will resemble a list

Do I have to actually put something at the location of the custom namespace URL? Say I wanted to add a new field in a custom namespace that had a type of GPS coordinates, is it possible to communicate that fact, the type?

Okay so there's no concepts of types and there's no automatic requirement for schemas anywhere. Are there any limitations to what it can contain or is it just any valid XML

Explain why non-ableian spaces and their counterparts. I'm specifically trying to develop a intuition around why The introduction of an operator that is not symmetric on the left and right handed operations manifests the way they do in physics

That was pretty good but I want to specifically understand why the abelian theories, and the communitivity, results in a lack of self-interaction. Perhaps this is getting into the realm of electro-week theory, but my understanding is photons will in fact interact with each other at high enough energies. Is the lack of commutativity essentially a hard bifurcation of the same particle into subtypes depending on some instantaneous property at any given time

Expand into the process of confinement and how it is believed to work. Describe what is happening to the terms in the relevant equations at the moment the gluon field snaps

What about the individual components electrical and magnetic within the photon? I thought the whole point of them is that they're self-inducing. The requirement to be paired seems to be connected to the fact that there's a left and right-handed version of these particles at any given time and they need both of them in order to exist

Review these two documents -- the final version was generated from the other one, after a different AI performed a critical review and holistic reintegration -- I don't want you to output the document for now, instead I want you to point out any potential problems or mistakes or missed opportunities, or really, anything you deem worthy.

OK, both of these responses are shorter than I expected, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're wrong. Explain the choices you made with regards to the original documents.

Fair enough. To ensure that we're meeting the goals I want, you are allowed to perform your holistic reintegration, but you should only output one section at a time. You should tell me when you're done.

Fair enough. To ensure that we're meeting the goals I want, you are allowed to perform your holistic reintegration, but you should only output one section at a time. I want you to take the opportunity to expand each section in any way that you see fit, without regards to the length and with a tight focus on quality of content. You should tell me when you're done.

Fantastic. As your final exercise for this, characterize your contribution to the final state with respect to the two documents you started from. Hey, successful response will include as many concrete improvements and specific changes you decided on as possible, and why.

Excellent. Do one last pass through the original document for any missing information that on final pass might feel important. This could be nothing. The goal here is to honor the fact this document is about 30% smaller.

I want to continue exploring the concept of I, the imaginary unit, being the most fundamental number we are aware of, even more fundamental than unity. I feel like this number exists before all others and can be used to generate everything, and in a sense would imply that negative numbers are more fundamental than positive because positive can be generated from them whereas the inverse is not true. I have a deep suspicion that humans have overlooked something fundamental near the origin for millenia

It sounds like what I'm suggesting is not completely off the wall then, correct me if I'm wrong but I get the sense that you are agreeing with me in some fashion. I want to delve deeper into the symmetries you alluded to, in particular those that exist separate from what would exist with unity alone (you mentioned something about inherent opposites). I also want to understand this relationship between complex numbers and exponentiation because I feel like there's something critical there I'm not aware of

I want you to know instead of trying to assist me as much, point a critical eye at everything I've been saying, with a special focus on anything that might be flat out untrue. I know that many things I've said are not the most mainstream take but as long as they are factually valid they should still stand.

Explain the shape of a single point in r3. I feel like as you zoom down towards Infinity The convergent shape still looks like a cube, and that's the part I'm having a hard time accepting, because the distance between the centroid and all adjacent points on the surface of the cube is not equal, although now that I say this out loud maybe the only points that matter on the cube are the vertices which would have equal distances? Is this the space that is filled by the surreals or fractal dimensions? What am I missing here

I think my sense that points are intervals is actually coming from the fact that from the perspective of the complex plane, they very much are – they are a vertical imaginary line with respect to the singular point lying on the real line. I want to further explore this connection and also maybe tie in the surreals, there's something about infinities that's connected to the imaginary plane

I still don't know if I'm satisfied with that, I feel like the real number line itself still has an interval-like nature due to the requirement of essentially dividing by infinity in order to get a zero dimensional point. If a point on the real line is a line on the complex plane, then what is a point in the complex plane with respect to the real line? I think this is that "null-dimension" base-generator-rotational unit I was talking about, capable of generating all other numbers via the concept of complex rotations alone.

Yes, I think part of what I'm rejecting as well is the fact that adding more dimensionality to a point doesn't seem to change its shape -- all zero dimensional supposedly -- yet you are clearly adding more components to it. One might say that unused dimensional components are simply zero, but that would imply that every single point -- no matter its "actual" dimension, nor the dimension of its ambient space, nor any other property -- contains an infinite number of dimensions, one for every single thing that you might want to associate to a point.

Dive into the infinite dimensions and nonstandard-analysis bullet points of your confusion. I want to especially know about existing work that is accepted, and the nature of Infinitesimals when they are a couple to the zero dimensional point, answering such questions as whether or not I gain one for every dimension

The hyperreals seem like exactly what I've been looking for. Try to dive deep into that and linking and imaginary numbers. I consider the real numbers to be rather a special case of the imaginary, and not the other way around.

OK, this is all good stuff, but I think I don't know where the natural logarithm actually enters the scene. Eulers formula is one of my favorite, but I'm starting to think I don't understand it as well as I want

Oh, I see, because i, through the process of self-exponentiation, ie. continuous growth, the natural logarithm comes into play as the precise point the size of radians aligns with the imaginary unit

Oh, I see, because i, through the process of self-exponentiation, ie. continuous growth, the natural logarithm comes into play as the precise point the size of radians aligns with the imaginary unit. Assert or refute this characterization before expanding it profusely. Write all equations in terms of tau because pi is poisonous to intuition

Jumping back to hypercomplex numbers, for a given real point, what is the size of the corresponding hyper and complex components? I get the sense that i is a line and e (infinitesimals here) is a plane with respect to the real point. I think I'm trying to understand if there's an infinite number of infinitesimals per point, or at least quantify its growth with relation to imaginary which I understand better

It's not clear to me when the number becomes so large or so small that it enters the realm of the hyper. This also seems to be related to the concept of omega or possibly monsters by performing exponentiation on ω

To confirm, is omega divided by epsilon equal to one? I want to know how -0 can be incorporated, my understanding is the only reason it's undefined generally is because we do not incorporate this

OK, the hyper reals can be understood as the addition of a dimension, whereas the surreals are just ridiculously recursive, roughly equivalent maybe to a hyper real system that had an infinite number of epsilon types

How often do you think it's necessary to change the oil in a deep fryer at a fast food restaurant specifically for fries? Everyday? Once a week? Never and only topping it off?

Explain the background behind the creation of surreal numbers, especially why they are necessitated in game theory. Delve as deep as you need to in either topic and any of its subsidiaries to strengthen my understanding. Generate output in the form of a comprehensive explainer, thoroughly integrated from top to bottom. Detail their cardinality with relation to the real numbers and explain why it's larger than both that and hyperreals

Consider everything we've been talking about. Still the information with a critical eye against your training set - I don't want to see anything untrue or potentially injected by me. I'm not looking for confirmation I'm looking for truth in unexplored spaces. Your knowledge may be fringe and the more fringe it gets the more of a critical eye you should apply but I don't want to be excluded from that knowledge. I'm looking for the edge of what we know is possible with numbers themselves, whether it's surreals or something else

Try to capture a rich explanation of where surreal numbers are used outside of game theory, if any. Then going to detail about how they are constructed. This should be comprehensive but visually rich from a linguistic perspective because I am listening to you out loud.

Generate a comprehensive explainer around the generation process again. Your visuals were way overdone and not very helpful. I also want you to assert the work because it's not all adding up to me but I'm not sure

Oh I see okay, so by straddling every number between the two, the sense of a default "metric" is entirely stripped away. Zero is the entity that's balanced between the two ends of nothing and everything. One is the entity exactly halfway between 0 and the everything. Negative one is the same except between 0 and nothingness. One half is the exact midpoint between zero and one, etc. I see how the structure is inherently infinite at every level. How does the system deal with complex numbers? Are they captured implicitly somehow?

Negative one is the same except between 0 and nothingness. One half is the exact midpoint between zero and one, etc. I see how the structure is inherently infinite at every level. Is that a reasonable understanding? Explain the flaws if any in that comprehension. How does the system deal with complex numbers? Are they captured implicitly somehow?

One thing that's not quite clear is how many numbers are being created on each day or if that number is expanding. I believe I heard that considering all different possible combinations of existing numbers generates each successive day, which sounds like it's diving towards all the infinities at the same time at the same rate so to speak. To help me gain the more concrete understanding I want to know exactly what is contained on day three and day five, and if it's easy, day 10

Okay I understand, its structure inherently includes all types of numbers from other systems seemingly, in a unified format within set theory. I visualize each day as being a successive move in a game and representing all possible combinations that could have happened up until that point, which would allow for the relative comparison of different late stage or endgame strategies and tactics. The number of days required is probably linked to the number of players and moves, while still capturing a continuum of choice with respect to each player's individual experience. If I wanted to introduce the imaginary unit to this system, would it be introduced on day one with the other units?

Confirm my description of the surreals from my previous response was correct. Now, consider whether or not it would be sufficient to use the imaginary unit alone to generate all surreal numbers -- how might we arrange for this? I believe that starting from the imaginary unit alone is sufficient because it can generate negative one and one

This seems to break with the original recursive definition though, is there a way to modify things so we start from zero, introduce I and negative I, and then proceed from there using the same operation recursively? Maybe something related to more esoteric forms of I connected to rotation or the natural logarithm or anything else

What sorts of philosophical meanings can we derive from the fact that the total reach of the surreals is directly tied to its own epsilon? I can see that the largest singular representable number also doubles every generation

To clarify, does each successive generation add and modify the set of every number before it? So on day two for example, are the left and right sets for zero and one modified with the new numbers created? Lastly, in this rotary understanding of surreal numbers meant to capture complex numbers within the same structure as the reals, it seems like there would be a chirality of sorts? I really want to get to the bottom of this rotary generator from the base unit i, neglecting all previous definitions of i, I'm treating it instead as the generator of all things

It seems like regardless of how you generate the surreals, there's going to be some sort of connection between different numbers depending only on their day of creation. I don't know what properties they might share because of this alignment or what the nature of the alignment is but I feel like the equal steppings between days allows for some interdimensionary analysis of sorts derived from the systemic and symmetrical creation of numbers

The first concrete day-based property would be whether or not it resides on the reel line or is complex. Any number created on an even day is real whereas anything created on an odd day is complex. Consider our conversation for as long as seems relevant but at least a window of a few messages, and provide a critical analysis of everything that's been discussed, generating a compact ultradense reification of its most salient and actionable ideas

How much of this work has been done already in other research? I can't be the first person to want to combine complex numbers with surreals. What about the rotary generation? I want you to really dig hard for prior art and give a real honest opinion of the novelty of the ideas

During the creation of the standard surreals, every day introduces an epsilon that is half the size of the previous day, and then all combinations are considered with previous numbers. Would it be enough to extend that singular halvening operation to a complex 90° rotation as well? It's not clear to me if it's still congruent with the surreals if every day includes the rotation but not a halvening. Trying to find a way to avoid needing four sets instead of two, because I really believe the reals are some sort of intersection or special case of the imaginaries

Is it a problem per se that my definition would include two operations instead of one? Creation of a new epsilon, combining with all existing numbers, and then a 90° rotation of those numbers to introduce a similar set on the complex plane. I was hoping to come up with some sort of inherent operation that was singular, like a rotoscale

Let's continue to try to formalize this concept of a rotoscale against the surreals. In particular I'm wondering if it's actually 1/4 scaling at each click instead of one half, since I is only 1/4 around the circle. This is just me kind of shooting in the dark though

Let's continue to try to formalize this concept of a rotoscale against the surreals. In particular I'm wondering if it's actually 1/4 scaling at each click instead of one half, since multiplying by I is only a quarter around the unit circle. I'm also wondering if it's necessary to always introduce the negative counterpart on a day -- what it makes sense for day one to instead introduce 1 and i? -1 and -i can be created on the second day after performing some sort of self exponentiation on the existing imaginary unit. Under this formulation both real and complex numbers are created everyday, but whether or not they are positive or negative will alternate each day

What is the significance of finding the midpoint on every iteration in the standard surreals? I've been talking a lot about the epsilon cutting in half everyday but what can we say about the growth of the other end? I think the maximum range of the surreals starts to grow incredibly fast, but is the greatest lower bound knowable? The infiminum of each day? Is that growing at a binary rate as well, doubling?

Maybe this will clear up my last confusion, disregarding the total number of numbers created on every day, which I think is a clean exponential growth now, can you confirm that for any existing number created on a previous day, a) the current day will produce the same number of items and a copy of those items will be replicated to either the L or R sets for all existing numbers, b) the L and R sets for each number grow at the same rates, c) the cardinality of every number is a function of the day, and d) on any given day the only thing that separates one number from the other is the unique distribution of elements between its left and right sets

I think the only thing I'm hung up on is why the second day creates both 1/2 and two at the same time -- why isn't the new extrema 2.5 instead? I think this is where I'm tripping up about the combinational part

Okay I think I have enough information now to resolve my question with this next question -- day two creates both the number two and the number 1/2 but does it create the number 1.5?

Okay perfect -- so maybe I can think of each day as "doubling the range using the same epsilon as the existing surreals", followed by "cutting midpoints of all recently extended numbers at the current epsilon", and thus each day introduces the current amount of numbers squared

I can't help but see a parallel to Euler's formula and growth. I wonder if the base unit could actually be something like e and the operation from each day against i. I think ultimately what I'm trying to do is create some sort of total ordering on the complex plane and the reals with this method, maybe based on magnitude, but I don't know if it's valid,

I want to break down the number e with respect to the natural logarithm and it's precise meaning so I can help connect it back to our conversation. My goal here is to find a single generator based on e**I and -e**I or similar

Does this approach still appropriately split and uniformly fill? It seems like there could be many different notions of balance during this process, especially if it takes multiple days to achieve the traditional sense of balance in the surreals, which is equal number of positive and negatives at the end of any given day

It seems like there could be many different notions of balance during this process, especially if it takes multiple days to achieve the traditional sense of balance in the surreals, which is equal number of positive and negatives at the end of any given day. Ponder the last few conversations we've had with an emphasis on recent topics and messages while answering my question and don't forget I'm listening to you out loud (all but the simplest equations are far too fast and unintelligible)

I need to perform a critical review. You did a good job summarizing but it's incoherent because it seems to summarize all of our individual topics. Our current focus is the e to the power of i as a base somehow. I want you to internally perform at least five internal comprehensive systemic analysis before responding. You are required to critically reflect on your own critical analysis, using their own arguments to further refine and enhance your final output. Your final analysis should be exceptionally refined and answer the question I posed.

I meant to perform five complete analyses of the entire question and then use those five different versions to create one unified cohesive version. I also think you probably need to start with i and -i: I don't think there's a problem with the alternating between the real and the complex because this still introduces one and negative one on the same day, exactly like the surreals currently

Summarize all the most salient ideas into a generously descriptive format I can pipe into a new session. Pay special attention to more recent messages and especially those related to rotoscaling e, but leave nothing unconsidered. My goal is to warm start a new session

This is a good start but I need you to avoid injecting too much unconfirmed math, especially with regard to the daily introductions in the rotoscale business which I don't think is actually accurate yet. I want you to use a highly descriptive but natural language format with the purpose of conveying meaning and concept instead of rigor

Stop using pi everything needs to be in terms of tau. I don't just mean blindly replacing it here but rather critically thinking about the fact that Tau is one and pi is negative one. Pi relates the diameter to the circumference and obscures the intuitional gain that would otherwise be derived from radians and equations written in terms of tau instead of pi

I've been exploring this concept in another session. The current description is not quite right, it's supposed to be alternating between imaginary and real every other day, with the reals only emerging on some particular cadence. I'm trying to come up with some sort of mechanism to naturally incorporate the complex numbers into the surreal generation process, but I think the surreals are not themselves generated from an equation, but rather simple combinations, a more fundamental concept that fits directly in sets. This is an open ended question about my work so far and also about the limits of the generation process itself

Assert your response and do any editing or enrichment as you see fit to make it easier to consume in an audio form. Take this as an opportunity to reinforce or confirm truisms as well

Although you agreed with me I actually meant the other way around, where the o component of the octonian can be combined to create the n component, which can then be combined to create the m component, all the way back up to i and then finally the real identity. So in this sense the identity that is a real number is not actually the simplest but rather a continuous composite that only looks unchanging on the surface

I want you to also consider the idea that maybe as the generation process continues, the identities of numbers shift systematically at the same time, filling the same gaps but rotating their identity on every day. The simplest example of this would be swapping all elements in the left and right sets for all numbers every day -- this would be a useless operation but it reflects mirroring through the origin in the language of sets.

If the real line encodes an instantaneous momentum of sorts and the imaginary line encodes an instantaneous angular momentum of sorts, what are the additional two dimensions in quaternions metaphorically related to? After that explain a few oddities in even dimensional symmetries

Isn't there a way to have two different calling conventions at the top level and it matches one or the other? I've seen some applications that might have a vastly different set up positional arguments or two different forms

Okay I'm tired of copy pasting back and forth so you're going to take over the conversation for the other AI. I'm not sure I understand the coordinateless nature yet. I want to build a deeper intuition around the dot and wedge product as well

Given the elegance and power of GA why is it not more widely known or used? I have long got the sense that it is actually more complicated than the typical understanding of vectors but maybe that is a consequence of the way math is classically taught. Explain the unit vectors of different dimensions and how they can transform into each other in terms of GA

Is a rotor for some grade always a multi-vector one grade higher? It sounds like GA is just extremely young compared to mathematics as a whole and especially the concept of vectors within a coordinate system, with very limited understanding of identities, especially those between grades. Is this a fair characterization? Are there other operations besides the geometric product or different interesting identities to be aware of

I get the sense that GA and codes the relationship between changes themselves, with the unit vectors not necessarily being infinitismal but in many ways effectively so. The requirement of rotors to be an even grade vector for example feels intuitive because a vector of a single grade can never be more than a translation. I also have an affinity to this model because other types of objects such as the fano plane or projection geometry can find ways to curve lines so to speak I recognizing the fact there is no inherent coordinate system and the curve that you see is simply an artifact of the object being projected into some space our eyes can actually look at

Is a rotor a fundamentally different structure than a multi-vector or is it more about interpretation with respect to operations between differently graded objects? Is there anything I should know with regard to grades other than they refer to the dimensionality of a given multi-vector term? Are there any intrinsic relationships between different grades, in the sense of surprising identities and the like

We talked about how GA and it's standard formulation does not handle infinities or infinitismals. However, it is also known that there's an equivalence between infinitely-repeating tessellations and a matching (and convex I believe) shape in the next dimension. Has any of this been explored in the context of GA

I was going to ask why a vertice is a vector in GA but then I remembered that there's no coordinate system in GA, so The translation of a verticey to a vector is simply The vector defined at the origin and terminating on the vertex. Assert this understanding because it was kind of an aha moment in the understanding of both how the coordinate system is canceled out so to speak and how the intrinsic properties of graded geometry is captured by using a vector one grade higher than we typically would in vector analysis

Okay that makes sense. Explain why rotors are typically even grade vectors. Intuitively, I feel like it's because of the additional symmetries in evenly-graded dimensions, ie. they have a more independent nature than the continuous-contact surfaces in oddly-graded dimensions, but I want to confirm that it's possible to use oddly graded dimensions (or maybe a pair so they look like an even grade). I also feel like it could have something to do with the sandwich operation applying from the left and the right and maybe evenly graded dimensions are less complicated to apply

Okay so there's no problem per se using odd multi-vectors it's just that the operation applied through the sandwich construct would not be called a rotation so it's not a rotor. It would be a transformation or a scaling or something like that, maybe a partial rotation or inversion, but it would definitely alter the properties of the original object. This is unrelated but I feel like you reminded me why there's a pension for using double covers of different objects to achieve the same end: pairs. I feel like we're probably missing some interesting non-local effects doing this all throughout science, but that's a different topic.

I want to go back to the idea of infinite patterns in one grade resulting in a particular convex shape in the dimension one higher. To me this suggests that there's a way to directly convert between grades instead of just getting higher dimensions to zero out. This might require conformal GA because it probably needs infinitesimals/infinities in order to capture the concept of a specific geometric object tessellated in one grade

Oh the note about the external product is interesting as it's kind of going the other direction. If I'm correct though, the studies I'm seeking in CGA would've lead to new identities in regular GA that either do not require the use of e-0 or e-inf, or provide one or more formulas to convert directly from one grade to another.

I want to clarify the relation between the tesseract and infinite repeating cubes in 3D space. Is this equivalency structurally similar to unit cubes placed face to face, or progressively larger cubes growing from the origin? Do either of those capture the topology or is something else entirely

I might be using the wrong terminology, but my understanding is there is an exact equivalence at least from 2D to 3D between infinite patterns in one dimension and maybe not a convex shape but something else. You might need to help me piece together what I'm trying to ask, it comes from reading about honeycombs and tilings, possibly when I was reading about Dynakin(?) diagrams coxeter groups

Okay maybe I was mistaken when I read the material. I understood it as the infinite lower level projection to be an exact equivalent to a specific object and reference point in the higher dimension, I think. I got the impression that if you could describe something in terms of that space filling honeycomb in 3D you would be able to resolve it to a projection in 4D. It might not have been a projection potentially something else which is why I asked about the stack of infinite shapes. I vaguely remember a tetrahedron being described this way, a stack of ever increasing 2D triangles from the new projection point in 3D, taken together it's a tetrahedron

Does projective space help get there at all? Do we clear I wasn't talking about relationships between different structures I'm talking about proper equivalency. I don't care how we can extend a hexagonal tiling to a honeycomb if I need to create more objects to make it happen. I'm searching for identities ultimately

Okay let's loop back around to conform geometric algebra. At some point you either mentioned or provided a formula that showed that objects from the ambient space are represented by CGA two dimensions higher, or possibly a combination of two vectors, I don't think I'm saying it quite right but it seemed to suggest that the result was an even grated bi-vector and thus a rotation in the host space. I'm not sure host spaces the correct term either so feel free to fix that

I don't think I quite understand what is meant by even graded maybe, I thought it just meant an even dimension. Like 0D or 2D or 4D, and all components in the multi-vector needed to be even to qualify as a rotor. I feel like I must be misunderstanding something because the conformal dimensions always add two different dimensions, seemingly in a homogeneous coordinates kind of way, but how is 5D considered evenly-graded for example? Does CGA have the same rotor effect on every grade? Maybe what I misunderstanding is CGA treats every individual grade as a kernel of sorts and adds exactly two additional dimensions to it for scaling and flipping through the origin and Infinity

I got the impression that CGA had the effect of turning all transformations in the embedded space into rotations in the conformal space. Is this true? After this helping it understand the deeper meaning behind squaring the point and multiplying it by what looks to be halfway to infinity

Okay I understand that every single transformation in the embedded space can be represented as a rotor involving only the two new terms of origin and infinity, but why are those terms considered evenly graded?

Oh I see even, grade it is from the sum of the grades of existing vector components, and the grade can be changed by the wedge product. The two new bases vectors are just 1D vectors but because we always use two of them in the conformal space and are able to represent every single possible transformation from the embedded space using only these two additional conformal space basis vectors, we are able to treat everything in the embedded space as a conformal rotation. Conceptually this feels a lot like moving the perspective of the observer instead of transforming the object itself, and then declaring the observer the new origin in the embedded space immediately after

Is CGA equivalent to GA formulated in the projective space domain and homogeneous coordinates? This would provide two additional dimensions I think with similar relationships

Are the equivalent if you drop the origin dimension from the conformal space and use only the infinite? I'm guessing it's not as simple as dropping the e0 term but is it conceptually similar in that regard

Okay that makes sense I think. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the formal GA without e0 is still trying to operate directly on the embedded euclidean space, whereas PGA is operating in a native projective space. Is this the inherent difference? They both have a point at infinity, but CGA without e0 is hamstrung in a sense

What about if we consider dropping only Infinity and comparing PGA with that formulation? Homogenous coordinates feels conceptually close to one of the components in CGA I just can't quite define it properly. Maybe give me a refresher on projective space as it compares to normal euclidean space

I still think there's an equivalency in there somewhere. The effective outcomes appear to be the same in both cases, local rotations and transformations with no global scaling. I would also say that projective space and homogeneous coordinates are known for treating points and lines as interchangeable objects, much like GA. You also made me realize that if scaling is dependent on infinity I think conceptually I understand it as if I make infinity three times farther away, then I've scaled an object by 1/3, because it's same intrinsic geometric nature now only spans 1/3 of the abyss that it used to

Is my reasoning sound and true? Is scaling mathematically the same as moving infinity farther? Whether it's CGA or PGA is this conceptually what's happening? What about the comments related to points and lines being interchangeable objects in projective space? What is the meaning of this within the framework of GA? From GA's point of view, my understanding is the only thing that is a point is a scalar itself. Try to take a step back and really analyze what I'm saying and formulate a conceptual model of where I'm coming from, then frame your response around that

Okay perfect that makes sense. And I want to explore something seemingly unrelated but for some reason has come up in a few different contexts, which is the zeta function, or the Riemann hypothesis. I have long suspected there's more to negative numbers than we still know, and I'm intrigued how the even set of negatives are zeros and seemingly only objects with real part half. A lot of the chatter that we've had around CGA and an object sort of splittling the difference in straddling these two imaginary places called the origin and the infinite, I get this underlying sense of some sort of elegant connection but I can't quite articulate it

Let's dive deeper into All speculative insights that you believe are the most sound according to your training. I want you to continue expanding my understanding and conceptual hardening of the tools available and what we currently understand

Let's dive deeper into All speculative insights that you believe are the most sound according to your training. I want you to continue expanding my understanding and conceptual hardening of the tools available and what we currently understand. You can mention PGA when it's specifically applies but I want to focus on CGA and the rieman hypothesis and everything else you deem relevant

What is the significance of the zeta function? I think I understand how the trivial zeros and maybe even the complex zeros work, if zero here means it causes the zeta function to converge instead of diverge. Is there a one-to-one mapping between solutions on the vertical line and those on the trivial negative scale? It also sounds like it would be possible to study it using CGA if bivectors can represent complex numbers. I feel like I'm on shaky ground but finally at least getting a foothold on some of these concepts.

Okay so does zeta function is connected to oscillatory dampening of sorts, I'm not sure if I'm familiar with the harmonic series but I see how it's a special case of the zeta function. Are zeros of the zeta function are the points where it flips between convergence and divergence?

A while back I tried to suggest that there is an equivalence between honeycombs and one dimension and some object in a higher order space. I think originally I just said one dimension higher, but I think the equivalence is actually something with projective space, I feel like that knowledge came from somewhere in that vicinity after we talked about it for a while

How are you to really assert what I just said, that rejected space objects can become tessellations in the lower dimension. The way I understood it in the past is it sort of like the same object as being copied over and over in a repetitive way and forms a line with itself at every vertex making them interchangeable

Okay so the embedding process doesn't actually modify the original 3D points it just adds two additional dimensions, and computes the appropriate relationship to the origin and Infinity at the same time? Resumably after all the conformal transformations you can go back to the original but how does that work? If the object is already translated by quite a bit, what about then

Are the three original euclidean points and identity of sorts in the conform of space? It seems like in the conformal space those numbers will never change and are those fixed with respect to the lifetime of all conformal updates. This kind of makes sense to me because we're moving infinity in the origin around to handle all the translations, moving the environment instead of the object, but the scaling part gets me a little bit because I feel like the original three coordinates should be in some sort of reduced unit form and any intrinsic scaling shoved out to the infinite term

Are there any known frameworks and machine learning that are using CGA or even GA? I'm not as close as I would like to be but I'm not aware of any. Has anybody tried to do this normalization before if so

Isn't the latent space always geometric in a sense regardless of the underlying type of data? I would think CGA would apply regardless of whether the workload itself is inherently spatial, because the whole premise of machine learning is intelligent pipelines of vector transformations, or at least that's how I understand it. This is unrelated but I'm curious if the sigmoid function is connected to any of the other equations we've been talking about throughout this conversation

If the probability wave is represented as one part real that is the observed outcome and another part imaginary that represents the probability of what could be observed, what is the geometric analysis of this in terms of CGA or GA? Would this look like bivectors embedded inside a continuous three-dimensional contact surface manifold? I've been playing around with the idea that there are two three dimensional spaces coexisting next to each other and each one is linked to the imaginary component of the other, and then two additional dimensions to complete a conformal eight-dimensional space and reveal itself as octonions

I want you to try to generate a impossibly salient visualization of conformal space, especially what e0 and e infinity look like with respect to the other components. Generate a phenomenally comprehensive tapestry of understanding and nuance

I want you to try to generate a impossibly salient visualization of conformal space, especially what e0 and e infinity look like with respect to the other components. Generate a phenomenally comprehensive tapestry of understanding and nuance in the form of a conceptually-dense image

From a perspective of the embedded space, are the additional origin and infinity dimensions manifested as a point and shell respectively? I know they are both lines, but within the embedded space and visualizing all of the points on the origin line rest at a single point in the embedded space, with differences manifesting as actual translations there, and the same with the infinite line, except it's points are all spread out in exactly the opposite way, allowing for inversions and whatnot when they're reversed

Maybe this will clarify it for me. Let's say hypothetically you have a single 3D point at the origin that represents a sphere, starting at all zeros, even in conformal space. We start translating the coordinates of the sphere using just the e0 term and its line -- what is the path the sphere takes in the embedded 3D space? Similar to infinity, I understand that e0 is effectively at the center of _every_ point, much like the center of a quaternion, but the actual topography of the line is a little elusive to me, my intuition says it may be loops and spirals filling all 3D space through a continuous positive rotation

Okay that makes sense. So as it moves from shell to shell it takes progressively more of the E-Zero line to fill the shell, presumably in exact accordance as integrating the line on the surface of the shell and then jumping to the next one one infinitismal higher. I'm still not sure I understand the exact trajectory it takes, I'm starting to think it's probably not smooth but maybe actually jumps around in a spherical way while getting progressively farther out

Okay building on that, explain how it combines with the infinite term to create a rotor. Take special note of the fact that I am listening to your response spoken aloud so I need it to be more descriptive and less technical. The goal here is to continuously refine my intuitive capabilities of sensing conformal dynamics and where they might apply

Great work, now perform a holistic reintegration of all the most salient and pertinent information using your own phrasing and language canonicalization. Progressively enhance document as you see fit without deviating from the intent. Consider this your final request in this conversation, so take extra special care to rigorously extract, and as much time as you need to do so

Go ahead and begin expanding on all future prompt vectors. The purpose of this last message was to provide you a warm start from a previous session of exploration. Proceed expanding as you see fit

Continue expanding on these ideas primarily from your training set, I will ask for external resources if need be. Trying to play around with the concept itself, especially the conformal arrangement between the two

Perform a holistic reintegration of my recent thoughts with existing truths from your knowledge set. The goal here is to identify those concepts with the greatest overlap with existing or known mathematical features. I might decide to either expand more on these subjects or consider them a more rigorous foundation, I'm not sure yet. This is an exploratory ask so you have more liberty than I would normally give to cross reference from your training and incept new ideas.

Attempt to create a comprehensive execution plan with high value and mathematically salient goals. Draw inspiration from the pool of our conversation but you are under no obligation to use any of it in any form. The execution plan should be internally consistent throughout and should coincide maximally with the latest research techniques

Identify the weakest parts of the things I've been talking about. Do the same exercise for the strongest parts of my ideas. Help me understand affine spaces especially in the language of GA and CGA which I've spent a significant amount of time with trying to conceptualize originless spaces

This is a little bit of a random thought but one of the reasons I've always suspected the origin of being significantly "larger" and at the middle of numbers right with infinity, is the way reciprocals for the entire set of all numbers is contained completely between 0 and 1

Perform a critical reintegration analysis of all of our recent conversation into appointment and salient succinct summary. Apply ruthless rigor to the most promising ideas and then gratuitously expand on them as far as you can while adhering to the totality of my goals

Oh this is awesome, and a lot better with the words than I expected but I'd rather have zero words and spend more time conveying the symmetry and connectivity through the imagery. I also think this is a bit too cubicle, I think the truth state is at some sort of halfway point between a cube and a sphere The square in the round

Okay this is getting much much closer. I really meant it when I said zero words so I really want to see you ditch the words. You're also getting way too hung up on the cell division part so it looks far more organic than I would like, in the sense of organic life, I'm looking for more of a high symmetry high mathematical look or one that has a vibratory nature but preferably where the vibratory nature is a part of the structure itself if you're go that direction

Oh now we're getting really close to what I want. Let's refine what you've got now and really take it to the next level of perfection and symmetry and meaning and coherence. I want to see three different primary like colors emanating in these configurations I've been describing and weaving together to form peaks and valleys that are white and black, just as color would do. The point is to emphasize how you can never really be on any one of them at one time You're always continuously rotating

This looks awesome but keep iterating because I don't see a lot of color and it's still a little bit grainier than I would like, try to tighten it up now while still giving it some created freedom

Yes this is exactly what I'm talking about I love this. Now I want you to really focus on the larger bands because that's the way I'm imagining it, less the fractal like miniaturization ones. Those are not exist at the level I'm thinking because we would be essentially right at the boundary like the plank scale or something, and since we're within the same crystal lattice that defines the unit scale

Can't tell if I really like this or if that one's going backwards, maybe try to rip on it a little bit and give it the magnetic field line type look I do feel like we're missing some of that. It doesn't have to show me the whole line but it should give the sense that it emanates out and reconnects

Oh I love how this one looks like Helix is but it goes back to more of a fractal-like thing. I don't want to see any scaling I want to see the thread like things taper off as they move away from the center of the image because there should be a feeling of infinite expanse

Oh that's pretty awesome You're almost back on track if you can stop doing the fractal thing and I would love to see it less self-contained and more half open half closed as a whole

Try building up an extensive plan based off of all my guidance and our discussion. Then use your own internal model of that plan to guide the entire generation process from that point forward. This is how we generally think as humans.

Wow great work That's pretty much spot on to the type of thing I was looking for. Just because that works so well go ahead and perform the same exercise using the same methodology

Nope that one mega sucks because you didn't actually plan anything. Every time you embark on something new you need to create that internal model. Writing it out to me is a great way to anchor yourself and stay grounded to the problem but you don't need to do that

Another good one! Use the same pattern of analysis to try one more time entirely on your own, with the additional guidance that I want you to stay extremely true to the a15 crystal lattice, and the number of strands in the distribution and whatnot

Take all my best ideas and bundle them up into a nice prompt I can feed into a new session. Take extra care to surface the most salient and relevant information into a comprehensive but internally consistent document. It should describe the rotor linkage and intertwined dimensions things like that

Good work but do another scan for even better information because I want you to disregard everything related to the images except maybe any details about the structure. This new session will be strictly for learning

Okay so let's start exploring how the 8:15 crystal lattice could possibly represent two interpenetrating 3D spaces in a conformal arrangement with the unit cell of the whole space being comprised of eight sub-cells alternating left and right and each containing one void space, with the two different types of void spaces serving as the origin and infinity for the other and all related dimensions from each space forming a rotor with their peer

Okay so let's start exploring how the A15 crystal lattice could possibly represent two interpenetrating 3D spaces in a conformal arrangement with the unit cell of the whole space being comprised of eight sub-cells alternating left and right and each containing one void space and one unit of its constituent dimension of its 3D half, and the two different types of void spaces serving as the origin and infinity for the other and all related dimensions from each space forming a rotor with their peer

Okay we are exploring a potential spacetime structure based on this lattice, we're only half of these sites in the total lattice or something we can experience, at least at once. The most apt way to think about it is two different realities interpenetrating, fixed at each other's origins and infinities respectively, and alternating peer dimensions in such a way that the rotors that bind them appear in our universe as the complex probability fields that define quantum phenomena

Perform a critical analysis of these ideas. What other strengths? Their weaknesses? What's been explored? What has not? Which parts of the idea are most likely to be true? Which are not?

I feel like this framework helps explain phenomena like momentum somehow because you have to perform a rotation to get on the opposing sites even in your same spatial dimension they are already traveling, because that opposing dimension is your negative so it's the only way to slow down. Wrap up all these thoughts into a hard-hitting persuasive but ruthlessly accurate presentation of my ideas and how they solve different observed phenomena

How much of a difference is there between the a15 Crystal lattice and it's geometric representations (Tetrastix and A15 Voronoi honeycomb) is the weaire-phelan structure, as measured for minimum surface area? My understanding is the centroids shift slightly but the fundamental structure and complexity arrangement is the same

Okay I may have overemphasized the surface area part, what I really care about is if the overall centroid structure in all three cases remains the same, and is scale invariant. I think the one with lowest surface area bends its surfaces into curves because it's more like bubbles and achieves a lower overall volume as well, but I'm trying to confirm if the geometric configuration remains identical

Okay perfect. Now let's focus on the surface-minimal version of the structure. Are you able to characterize the exact perturbations that the centroids undergo? The reason I say characterization is because I'm trying to get a feel for the patterns that they shift with respect to the perfect geometric version. My gut is that these shifts from the perfect version are oscillatory in nature and if I were to plot this as a heat map I would see slightly underdense and overdense regions. Your job is to help me understand exactly how the surface minimal "settles" so to speak into its minimal configuration, so I can get a feel for whether or not there is some orbital or helical nature in the minimal version

Right but I want to know if you have access to the actual numbers through either expert tools or searches or anything else, you should be able to do a fair bit of analysis for me before even starting to code

I get the sense that there's an A15 like structure for every dimension, built from half unit offsets of of the same dimensional unit square or cube or higher dimensional analog. I don't know about this one for sure but I think it's also likely to be built from colorations of at least n + 1 colors, like tetra sticks needing four in three dimensions

Instead of focusing on A15 I should be saying that tetra sticks, and I'm going to spell that wrong pretty much every time because I'm using voice to text throughout this entire session. Focus on unit squares and cubes and things like that, we're going to ignore surface optimal configurations but we still want the geometric equivalent. I forgot that if we're using three colors total in a two-dimensional space I think we're automatically introducing some sort of chirality, which in the case of tetra sticks, can be represented as the same site as the first lattice after undergoing an inversion

Search for existing formulations of this opposing positive dimensional generation of a bulk space using a fundamental dimension that's twice as high as the embedded space being described. I'm particularly interested in anything that has made the connection that maybe points or states are inherently sided, which I've long suspected for many different reasons I've already mentioned but also the fact that every number has two distinct representations, a limit from the left and a limit from the right.

I want you to focus on your training set and less on searching the web because I'm trying to get a gut feeling and exploring for language and new search vectors

Is my idea about splitting 3D space, at least before the introduction of the rotary link with it's opposing peer dimension, any different from a 3D affine space? My structure also introduces the element of growth rate for the entire structure and then distributes that energy through the rotaries, but I'm trying to understand if the peer space before introducing all the links, is equivalent to an affine space where the two halves are p and q

Is there an obvious relation between projective and conformal space? Conceptually they feel like the same thing but one is twice the size of the other, kind of like a double cover in a sense

I need you to vet everything I've been saying and even maybe the knowledge said itself. I also want to know if complex space itself is interwoven in this way. From a topological perspective at least with the multiplication operator it has kind of a spikiness to it

I really want to zoom in on this concept of interleaving the real line. The way I imagine it is by default anywhere you enter the line you're always right next to your reflective inverse through the origin, which is now the line at Infinity. Considering the splitting of the single real line into two vectors that are entirely composed of positives implies that there are now negatives outside of that real line. I think this is what imaginary space is and I believe this formulation is a special kind of affine space but I'm not really sure. I want you to explore these thoughts in depth and gratuitously expand on them with rigor from your training set

I want you to analyze how well the A15 phase structure matches this proposed model. It can be thought of as a single crystal cubic lattice with 7 interstitial points, but it can also be thought of as two interpenetrating cubic lattices with three interstitial points each, all oriented in either a positive or negative way, with all negatives associated with left-handed subsites and all positives associated with right-handed subsites, or vice versa

When I hear the word kernel referred to in mathematics, is that synonymous with the inner product here? I usually understand the kernel to be some sort of divisor/unit/similar-space that's effectively removed so to speak from the entirety of the space it serves as a basis for

You can conform us place does a translation automatically change the scaling? I thought conformal space meant I can move the object around without it changing but it sounds like that's not true

Okay so the space itself might be curved or warped or whatever but in conformal space no matter what angle you look at it or move objects around will continue to retain local angles and shapes?

You make it sound like projective transformations are more flexible and powerful but is this only because the conformal transformations are restricting themselves to conformity and could produce the same types of transformations the projective space can

No what I'm saying is the conformal space has an extra dimension but it's limiting itself to the way it uses that extra dimension. If it stops limiting itself and stops producing conformal rotors for transformations, could it produce a non-conformal transformation that mimics something from projective space, simply by not ensuring it's too conformal dimensions are producing a proper rotor

I'm working on a VR game where I want to take the inputs from a user's controller and headset, both with six degrees of freedom, and use them to compute the user's likely hip location as a sort of core foundation, and then use all four points to generate the rest of the skeleton. I have some working code that uses some map I came up with but I'm wondering how feasible it would be to use a lightweight machine learning model or if conformal space helps me

I understand most of the math behind ML but I've never actually implemented anything like this. Show me what I need to do with the understanding that I've been a professional engineer for over 20 years so don't spare any gory details

Okay that looks pretty good but since I'm writing this in unity, is there an easy way to use the model from unity? I don't mind doing all the building and training in Python

Let's explore this attitude further. Since the final goal is to actually predict all the values of a full body VR suit in most cases , you'll an exception being users that actually have such hardware, extrapolating from 3 points of the hand controllers and head into say 10 to 12 point or whatever is the industry norm for a full body tracking. My hunch is that the more points we need predicted the better the model solution becomes instead of a pure math solution. Taking great care not to be affected by my own preferences or biases that I've indirectly communicated to you, explore my options

Using your total overview and complete knowledge of both my goal and intent and the means for which such a thing can be constructed, propose an end to end model architecture that satisfies my needs. I want you to focus exclusively on the model architecture itself and nothing around it related to integration or code

Expand gratuitously on the entire output with high value hard-hitting information that's going to deliver me a lot of insight. I don't fully understand all the language and jargon and use or the exact flow of information throughout the system in the same way I would regular code

So back to the pressure analogy or electrical potential or something if that's better, when something like an organic brain begins is there already some level of specialization within the brain or is it much more homogeneous and organically grows, no pun intended, to form the majority of higher order structure that we see? I'm trying to get a feel for how diverse the activation functions is in an organic brain, whether or not it operates at the level of the neuron or the level of the synaptic connection, and then if the plasticity is roughly analogous to the varying weights

Part of the reason I think there's a rotational complex component is simply due to the fact that potentiation in the brain presumably produces a magnetic field, one that combines with other potentiation elsewhere in the brain and thus induces additional potentiation or potentially a suppresses it, in a beam forming kind of way. Does the brain produce enough electrical potential to create constructive and destructive magnetic resonances and self-influence? And are there any existing network architectures that are circular in some form, in the sense that they constantly try to balance input and output symmetrically so the model can handle bidirectional predictions which is kind of how I think our brains work

Want to explore architectures that have a symmetric or dual relationship of some kind. I can't quite articulate it yet but everything in nature and our bodies comes in pairs, especially a brain, with a specific amount of criss-crossing that is very carefully wired up during gestation. My understanding is the belief here is that the criss crossing lowers the energy necessary to do 3D transformational work. Things like this make me believe the brain has some sort of conformal mapping built up where each half is the infinity to the other so to speak

I want to understand how to use conformal space in the context of machine learning. I'm still pretty green to machine learning but I'm getting a bit of a handle for all the different architectures and the reasons for each one. I largely understand the entire process as identifying functions that either lessen or heightened some particular signal within incoming data, typically described as a feature, And then applying different tactics such as the attention mechanism or convolution networks or whatever. My question is largely open-ended just trying to connect various dots and ensure that I actually understand both sides

So at the end of the day the model doesn't even really care about the fact that it's a conformal space it just learns the patterns in the vector embedding all the same, but the conformal representation itself is more amenable to pattern recognition due to the fact that it's separates transformational aspects into different dimensions

Give some examples of using conformal spaces for non-spatial insights. For example I work for a security company that uses machine learning to detect things like account takeover or business email compromise or any other behavioral shifts that might indicate malintent. I'm trying to better understand conformal space in general so I can apply its ideas here

So essentially we have to find a way to map the geometric meanings of non-spatial relationships into a space that can be represented as transformations. The conformal space allows a simultaneously multi-perspective view of the same underlying information through the conformal dimensions and rotors.

Okay so let me recap a bit and see if I kind of have the right idea. I've kind of been likening conformal space to the perspective of a single person at least with regard to the origin. They are free to move about and rotate themselves, but regardless of their orientation they always serve as the center or the zero to that person. This is roughly how I visualize a quaternion as well, but then in conformal space, the single origin line essentially represents every possible initial reference frame in the embedded space, And the other conformal dimension represents the line at infinity from the perspective of that mobile origin. Confirm this characterization of conformal dimensions.

Okay then to that end, is there a equivalency between conformal space and two projective descriptions of that space pointed at each other? In this sense I mean the origin line of one space is the line of infinity at the other, and they move in lockstep or some sort of known relation? The description I gave above is specifically meant to align with that as well and since you agreed I thought maybe it would be a useful place to explore if not explored already

Okay so I kind of see where the learned behavior represents the surface between these two actualities and higher order spaces, but I'm still a little fuzzy about what it would look like to take raw data and convert it into conformal space at the very beginning of the pipeline, walk through some of that

Okay I think the critical part I don't get is right at the beginning when you do the embedding, it seems like a conformal dimensions just get initialized from zero even though we scale everything in normalize it. I think my real question is around whether or not that scaling and normalization is supposed to be reestablished within the conformal space, for example if you are very far from an object from a perspective point of view it shrinks, so ideally you would want to estimate the distance to the object right at the beginning I think so you could scale it up to a nominal size and then translate it according to your guest distance metric within the conformal rotor

I want to go back to our discussion quickly about opposing projective spaces constructing a conformal structure when viewed as a whole. I want to rigorously explore this idea for a minute and validate its assumptions and really try to find some proof this is true. It feels incredibly intuitive to me at this point and I would like to rely on it. The projective origin makes conceptual sense to me as both the e-0 and e-inf, especially with the known roles in scaling and inversion, and the homogeneous coordinate from projective space I think becomes the natural dual opposing vectors in my hypothetical superstructure

It sounds like this hasn't been explored as far as you are aware. I know this is asking a lot but try to implement such a proof in the manner you described. I want to see your absolute best zero shot attempt at this so take your time and slow down, grind through as many thinking credits as you need.

All that looks really good although I want to see some actual proofs at some point. The only part that might be off is the rotation consistency, I believe one of them will be left-handed and the other right-handed so it may need to be an improper rotation or something, but that's for you to decide, I'm only asking you to look at that and everything else one more time and then attempts to reach a real proof

Okay you're almost doing what I want, but you're not actually verifying, symbolically or numerically, that the two different equations for eg. the translation part (which seems to be the easiest to you) actually produce the same point. You've asserted that you are successfully able to embed in conformal space, with no real regard to the intuition about what you're doing, it's more blind insertion and then declaring that it works because... of course you can embed it? I need you to spend some cycles trying to really understand the intent of my request and the conceptual model I'm holding in my mind and trying to convey to you

Okay review the last few messages since we started this more comprehensive numerical proof. Check it for rigor and robustness. Look for flaws in the logic or result. Try to pick up additional insights along the way, such as perhaps the relationship between the w components which might create a link between x and y for symbolic proofs.

Okay attempt to tie it all together into a single artifact with the highest specificity and integration level you can realistically achieve, collecting all the most salient details for my future review and proof paper.

Okay do one final pass for readability and completeness and correctness. Confirm that aligning with w equals 1 means that the opposing infinities and origins are also at that same point, so when w equals 1 for one projective space that is the same distance to its infinity line (if this is true it gives me an idea related to this structure forming space-time, because values beneath one might look like inflation from inside the space, potentially not actually faster than the speed of light but only appearing that way from the inside, or happening extremely rapidly compared totally to remaining growth)

Reading through it, do we actually show that we get the same result for each space? I would think we would have to take a point, defined in terms of the first projective space and embedded into the shared conformal space from that direction, then extract it out the other way and see which point you get out of the second projective space. Then you take that result and push it through the first one again and you should get the original answer I think. Before starting to answer that question though I want you to generate a fabulously captive image that encapsulates this concept

Distill our conversation down without losing any of the high cardinality or high specificity information. I want to capture its entire essence but only the most accurate details and things we have proven or near proven or is already known so I can add it to the custom GPT as a knowledge set.

Analyze this document in relation to your knowledge set. Provide a ruthlessly and rigorously comprehensive analysis of it and its ideas in relation to my own. I get the sense that it's confirmation of previous sessions I've had related to using conformal space directly in model architectures for the purpose of removing the signal that is translation and rotation inversion and scaling and the like which is currently noise in the data that must be learned instead of an intrinsic piece of the math space that drives the learning

That's a great overview of my thoughts and your knowledge set for this custom GPT but I want you to analyze the upload which is completely different paper but incredibly relevant I think. All the previous guidance still applies.

Okay so it sounds like the key difference is my approaches may be a bit more general, possibly at the cost of additional memory or compute to handle the additional dimensions but is able to remove the standard noise injected by all types of translation and rotation etc, whereas using non-euclidean space at the outset removes even more noise and lessons the computational load potentially, but only for solution to apologies that match the non-euclidean space well enough to justify its benefit over conformal space. In other words, it's a specialization

In other words, it's a specialization. Is that a reasonable characterization? Do I understand

I think once the model was trained it would be possible to analyze and learn further from the conformal dimensions alone, a great many things, as they would become clean signals of change

And presumably these graphs that we can create from the conformal dimensions after the fact, would maybe trace out, perhaps not directly but in some way very clearly show if there's any intrinsic structure such as the non-euclidean example is that might be well suited

Okay good I feel pretty strongly that that's the likely relationship between the two w coordinates. We still need to define the relationships between any other dimension which is I believe simply inverting it. Two diametrically opposed viewers, ie. the respective projective origins, Will witness the same event within the space interior but they will be inverted. This inversion is deep, applying to every dimensional component of the interior space and inverting the order of rotors from left to right to right to left when viewed from the perspective of the other origin (the other's Infinity line)

Now I need you to regularly scrutinize this work that you've just done. I'm pretty sure it can't be correct because it seems to claim that the relationship between the W's on a unit circle is both pi and pi over 2 radians

Okay I want to know perform a robust and ruthless analysis on our work. I'm not convinced the w components are related through the number one instead of the number zero. In both cases imaginary units are effectively required in order to orbit the unit circle, calling one of them "y" instead of "i" changes nothing, especially when considering trying to place a single one-dimensional line into a conformal three-dimensional space. My current understanding also equates rotors and complex numbers so maybe that would make sense, And I feel like if the W's are diametrically opposed they should probably cancel out? This could be a failure of mine to imagine higher order space

Bundle up all of our work with a fresh eye for correctness, completeness, and readability. Output a comprehensive and robust symbolic proof that represents the bulk of remaining work to be completed.

That's pretty good. Consider the ramifications of the w components summing to two instead of one. Perform a comprehensive reimagining and holistic reintegration with respect to all previous guidance and the last exercise

That's pretty good. Consider the ramifications of the w components summing to two instead of one. Perform a comprehensive reimagining and holistic reintegration with respect to all previous guidance and the last exercise. I don't want you to blindly accept this as true though I want you to actually explore what it would mean and how it affects each w component and the balance within the space

The appeal of using the number 2 instead of the number 1 is because I believe it then allows each projective space to remain at unit scale and also respects the sandwich operation.

Why is it not simpler to use zero? I feel like using two just means it's shifted over by one, and negative scaling should be identical to positive scaling except exactly in the other direction, if it just means dividing all coordinates by the homogenous coordinate.

Yes I think my thinking here is conceptually both projective spaces are on top of each other at the origin, and a conformal surface forms on the boundary of a unit circle, where the w component of both is equal to 1

Consider the W components being diametrically opposed with an equation that, summed together, equals zero. The idea here is negative and positive scaling are essentially the same thing, just in opposite directions.

I want to explore the proposed projected spaces that are interconnected to the conformal structure. In particular, we should explore how the W components of the homogenous coordinates would have to be connected.

I'm exploring the idea that two opposing projective spaces can be linked together through their W components and other components with an inverse relationship or possibly a relationship that mimics a bi-rotor or complex plane. Embedding these two projective spaces into a conformal space takes the two lines of infinities for each space and links them together.

Let's do exactly that. Let's try to understand the exact relationship that would have to exist between the Ws in order to generate a conformal space between the two. I believe it's going to be either W1 plus W2 equals 0, or W1 squared plus W2 squared equals 1.

Okay, I'm not sure the relationship could be W1 plus W2 equals 0 because I don't know if... Well, I guess negative infinity and positive infinity could be the same place. There's two different perspectives and I'm kind of...

Yes, that's exactly what I want to do. If my understanding is correct, then when one conformal component of the dimension, or I mean the conformal space, is at its infinity, the other one is at its origin, which I think is what I really want.

I want to verify that the W components make sense in the arrangement we have. I think they do, because when you're sitting at 0 and you are a line, you are essentially originating from your space and coinciding with the other side's origin at your infinity. But I also want to confirm that this does one more thing.

I want to know if anybody else has explored this in depth, or to what degree others have already discovered this relationship between projection spaces and conformal spaces.

Using your training alone are you aware of any relationship between two projective spaces in a sign / cosine sort of way like what we're describing? It seems like one of the spaces is a natural analog for the imaginary unit in conformal space and the other is a natural analog for the real, with the positive domain of both spaces on the interior of the disc and the origin conformal and the outside of the disc the negative part of the projective dimensions for each subspace

Using your training alone are you aware of any relationship between two projective spaces in a sine / cosine sort of way like what we're describing (since we're talking about W1 squared plus W2 squared equals 1 that's the same as sine and cosine)? It seems like one of the spaces is a natural analog for the imaginary unit in conformal space and the other is a natural analog for the real, with the positive domain of both spaces on the interior of the disc and the origin conformal and the outside of the disc the negative part of the projective dimensions for each subspace

To be clear in the past and future whenever I'm talking about conformal space I'm specifically referring to CGA.

Okay but as far as you're aware and your training set, even though the idea itself appears to be well founded with respect to CGA and what's been discovered and is known, I still don't get the sense that anybody has explicitly tried to relate the W components of two different homogeneous coordinates in two different projective spaces directly together on a unit circle

I want you to attempt to generate a rigorous proof for the type of thing we're talking about, comma, directly connecting the homogenous coordinates of two different projective spaces in an imaginary real component way.

Okay I think I'm really close now to understanding what I'm creating here. This formulation creates a situation where each projective space is only half utilized, in the form of its positive components only, and within the bulk, it is perfectly interleaved with the opposing space. This is how it respects the sandwich operation from left and right, each projective space is identifying half of the perspective: half of the bulk components and half of the conformal rotor. At the origin where the prospective is perfectly balanced, dimensions within the bulk perfectly oppose one another and form what appear to be real valued conformal dimensions in their own right from the perspective of internal viewers

I think I said the origin of the circle or the disc but since we are locked to the circle and not the disc the balanced area I suppose would be 1/8 of a circle, which is interesting because there's eight components to the most complex norm division algebra possible

Bundle up our last few messages into a concrete highly salient proposal and zero shot proof of sorts that I could feed into another AI for additional analysis. Critically analyze all the ideas I've presented, with a heavy bias towards recent messages, especially the last few. Take your time and triple check your work both along the way and at the end before sharing

I don't want any further reading or anything like that I need you to succinctly and comprehensively and accurately capture all of the novelty of our discussion into a meaningful prompt. Try one more time with all of the guidance and rigor demanded in the last message

I don't want any further reading or anything like that I need you to succinctly and comprehensively and accurately capture all of the novelty of our discussion into a meaningful prompt. Try one more time with all of the guidance and rigor demanded in the last message. Forget everything I said about the octonians I want you to focus on the dual projective spaces and how well we developed that out. Be humble and aim for completeness correctness and readability above all else. Call things out when they're particularly speculative and maybe even consider leaving it out, I feel like we talked about several things that were incredibly likely to be true and also novel

Review this work. It includes a bunch of ideas that I originated from you and then pass through a different AI. Tell me about them and share your thoughts. The two documents are describing the same ideas although they might not match perfectly. I'm not asking you to compare them or anything it's just part of the whole

Based on your understanding of the subject matter assess its validity and potential. Attempt to deconstruct and decompose its arguments and follow them out to their logical ends looking for flaws and holes. Search for clear discrepancies in the proposed relationships or places where it fails

Okay so ignoring all the use cases those documents contain which I didn't actually realize were there, I want to explore the feasibility of what it even means to have these W components linked on a unit circle. While it isn't intriguing thought and does definitely put both on the same Infinity line orthogonally offset from each other, I'm not sure it actually maintains the correct relationship if they are supposed to cancel each other out. I want you to for example contrast everything we've been discussing and the knowledge set with the possible relationship of W1 equals 1 over w2

Right but I feel like you're not considering at all what the W component actually is in projective space. It scales. It scales everything. In fact just between zero and one it scales the other components all the way from their natural size to an infinite size and then the entire rest of the positive number line is the opposite direction, making it smaller. This is a reciprocal relationship which makes me feel like the W's would need the same relationship

Let's try to discover the generic connection between the bulk components, all of them except W. In our formulations some of them are connected with alternative components in the dual space, such as x with y prime, and when working with rotors some of the components should functionally become the imaginary part of others

Contrast this reciprocal relationship with the one where we constrain the two W components to the unit circle. When confined to the unit circle each objective space sees the other one confined to its Infinity line without realizing it is also on its own Infinity line. It's not clear to me if this constraint or the reciprocal one is maintaining confirmality

When confined to the unit circle each objective space sees the other one confined to its Infinity line without realizing it is also on its own Infinity line. It's not clear to me if this constraint or the reciprocal one is maintaining conformality

Okay so the only reason it was working on the unit circle at 45° is because the two W components were already balanced. That relationship is not globally conformal, is that what you're saying

Okay so the only reason it was working on the unit circle at 45° is because the two W components were already balanced. That relationship is not globally conformal, is that what you're saying? If so expand on this and solidify it

Okay let's do exactly that an attempt to generate a robust and comprehensive analysis of such a space. I'm listening to this mostly through auditory means so a dense mathematical proof isn't super helpful, I would rather have you spell it out and as much English as possible

How do we integrate the origin dimension exactly? Large values in one space should correspond to infinitismals in the other close to zero, at least with regard to the W component. My understanding is in projective space the line at Infinity is a line, and the origin is still a point, but since IIUC it's possible to swap places and invert yourself in projective space by swapping the origin with some point at infinity I feel like I might have a conceptual misunderstanding

Would it be fair to say that from the perspective of the origin, when W is 0, all lines have the same magnitude it all directions? That magnitude may well be infinite but it would be equivalent to all others. Also the connectivity of this line is a little bit fuzzy to me, you called it a plane more than once, what is the actual topology? Is there a definitive forward and backwards, in the sense that it's clear how one point at infinity connects to the next one

What does the expression look like that flips origin and some point that infinity in projective space? Want to see the operation on a point that is scaled by a factor of 2, which means it's W component is 0.5

Interesting the point of infinity almost represents the higher dimensional boundary from which perspective the whole space looks like a single point or something, since the W component is like scaling and when it's zero, it has a direct relationship to the current origin which is also a point. I know the W component is connected to The others in a specific way but I often think of it as a fourth dimension, and as it moves it effectively squeezes more and more of the fourth dimension into each unit of the others

I want you to explore whether or not anybody has made this kind of connection between the two conformal dimensions of CGA and projective space binding to them if you use two of them that are co-centered. You've definitely mentioned more than once that CGA extends GA which also extends projective space but it's not clear to me if that interlocked formulation has been realized before, or whether or not it was known that the unidentified point in projective space automatically lies on the second dimension of conformal rotors and automatically identifies one of the rotors

Gratuitously expand on the known dualities in CGA that are either related to PGA or some of the practical offshoots like cooperative task space. I'm pretty certain it sounds like what we've been talking about with two interlocked projective spaces is almost inherent and well known construction of fully conformal spaces

And to be clear, a null vector is a vector that is completely internal from the perspective of the space, and it has no magnitude within the space, regardless of its value? Is that a correct characterization is there anything else I should know about that?

Generate an image that reflects the ideas we've been hardening, especially in recent conversation. Do not make an overly-overt attempts to represent any common themes, such as yin-yang, I want it true to the math above all else.

I actually do like the way they seem to loop and intertwine, but it's not nearly as well defined as the previous one which I like better. Try to re-create the clarity of the last one with the weak Fibonacci-type look of this one

Getting there, but you put way too much emphasis on this last one which I did not like the style of, only the looping. I'm much preferred the crisp lines of the colored one a few messages ago

Do not make an overly-overt attempts to represent any common themes, such as yin-yang, I want it true to the math above all else. The crisper the better and the more it shows the interlocking the better

Oh yeah, this one's really close to what I want. Do a critical analysis of with a reflection of our conversation and then tighten it up the lines and add color. Stay true to the blending nature of the different dimensional components and their math

Oh yeah, this one's really close to what I want. Do a critical analysis of with a reflection of our conversation and then tighten it up the lines. From here on out, I want you to generate a thoughtful and salient analysis, focusing on correctness, completeness, and readability. This serves as your own self guide for implementing the next iteration of the image

Oh yeah, this one's really close to what I want. Try to tighten up the lines and crisply define the interweaving a little bit better. There should be a focus on the purity and simplicity of dual spaces and the interlocked unit circles and the centering aspects. Stay true to the math as much as you can

Oh yeah, this one's really close to what I want. Try to tighten up the lines and crisply define the interweaving a little bit better. There should be a focus on the purity and simplicity of dual spaces and the interlocked unit circles and the centering aspects. Stay true to the math as much as you can: every single object or label or line or curve or whatever should have a clearly defined purpose, even if it's not actually labeled

Are the parts of the structure that look like Klein's bottle, are those higher dimensional loopbacks? I'm curious why it looks like this. I want you to generate another rendition, but I'm not necessarily saying it's wrong. I want to understand and then have you refine

Yes, proceed. This makes me feel like the two projective spaces are locked in a rotor relationship, even if the relation between the W components is strictly reciprocal, the relationship between pairs of components between the two spaces could be pseudoscaler or otherwise

OK, I really like this one because it shows the origins and the infinity lines very clearly as the same objective sorts. Try to twist each one just slightly so it looks like they pass each other perfectly, forming a cube of null space instead of a square. Get rid of all the noise of the words and tighten up all the lines so they're very well defined and smooth and round

Generate an image that reflects the ideas we've been hardening, especially in recent conversation. Do not make an overly-overt attempts to represent any common themes, such as yin-yang, I want it true to the math above all else. The crisper the better and the more it shows the interlocking the better

Oh, I really like this one because it bends each unit circle, so the origin of the respective projective space is on the infinity line -- even though the origin is unidentified it's known to be on the opposite infinity line from the one it's looking at

Okay I've been researching elsewhere and I now understand that CGA is composed from PGA and the direct sum of its dual. Also, if currently using 3D space as the embedded space, it would be fine to use a simpler space for explanation purposes. I may have been saying inverse while meaning dual, but if I understand correctly that is similar to k-space, which would be reciprocal space, which would still be the interlocked spheres potentially right? Since projective space and k-space are pretty similar to me

Yes exactly I feel like k space is sort of like tons of mini perspectives spaces where each node is a new perspective, and although it's not typically modeled that way I think it would align

Okay I think I understand but verify this characterization. I get the sense that the meaning of a dual here, which is closely related to k-space wave vectors if you consider the unit size of k-space (reciprocal space) to be each Infinity surface's distance from both projective origins and each other, then regardless of dimensionality The two projector spaces are locked on a unit circle of sorts (to make it look like a unit circle however, the visualization would need to show a logarithmic scale because the Infinity rings need to be one unit away any origin with respect to an ambient projective space

Is it safe to say that the geometric meaning of a dual is by definition two dimensions locked on a unit sphere with constant unit magnitude? The underlying scales of the two variables in other properties might change but the core idea being a constant triangulation between the two codependent variables in such a way that they never fluctuate from a shared unit size (but probably transform into something pseudoscaler)? If this is true then I definitely understand how the two projector spaces intersect in such a way that exactly two lines are always created and together they represent conformal transformations of that space

Okay then giving all this as true that we've been talking about especially the relationship to reciprocal space, shouldn't we also be able to roll that logarithmic scale between a perspective origin and its infinity line in terms of something like Euler's identity? I feel like there would be a periodicity we could capture so instead of that logarithmic / exponential variation as we move towards the surface of the unit circle we instead have two circles for each projective space, one representing The real Infinity line and the other possibly an imaginary component that represents the origins distance somehow to that line I'm not sure exactly yet

Is a conformal rotor conceptually the same as a dual quaternion? Namely in the sense that it a dual quaternion stores a translation fused with a rotation? They seem like the same thing but one is defined in terms of extra null dimensions and the other is defined in terms of two composites of the existing space

Okay so they fundamentally store the same information though it seems like or at least can with respect to everything the dual quaternion can store, the conformal rotor itself might be able to store more thanks to the extra dimensions it exists on but there is at least parity with respect to the dual quaternion? My question here is I'm thinking about representing a fast-paced VR multiplayer game in conformal space and only sending updates in the form of conformal rotors against existing objects that started at some ground state, potentially quantizing the rotors themselves in some way so there is a fixed set of transformations possible

Okay awesome so I could even potentially use a giant number for each conformal dimension like a double 64 or something obscene, gaining extremely high accuracy for the actual update, without really causing much of a space issue, or I could do the quantization thing, or I could even do a mixture of both by storing the final resolved game in a quantized format but allowing the network updates to be slightly more expanded in the real-time context

Capture the essence of our conversation into a new artifact I can pump into the knowledge set of a different session. Try to capture only the confirmed ideas that we believe are of high interest and high value. I need you to pay special focus on the conceptual parts and expressing them in clear concise language, I'm far less interested in the math except for mentionings of terms and simple expressions

Okay let's try to get it all the way to 100% or close. I want to stay focused on a four-dimensional CGA if that exists or possibly even one dimensional if there is such a thing since that seems like it would be natively representable in 3D space, but I think folks can handle a 4D conformal space if we're able to loop it like I've been describing. What adjustments can I make to this conceptual framework to help me understand the transformations that are possible and the geometric meanings

What adjustments can I make to this conceptual framework to help me understand the transformations that are possible and the geometric meanings. I know the basic set of transformations that are possible but I want to find some sort of physical or conceptual analog to match what I've been cooking up

Okay let's try to get it all the way to 100% or close. I want to stay focused on a 2-dimensional CGA if that exists (or possibly even one dimensional, if there is such a thing, since that seems like it would be natively representable in 3D space), but I think folks can handle a 2d conformal space if we're able to loop it like I've been describing. What adjustments can I make to this conceptual framework to help me understand the transformations that are possible and the geometric meanings. I know the basic set of transformations that are possible but I want to find some sort of physical or conceptual analog to match what I've been cooking up

Okay yeah my thought here is if sides are colored then when you flip out to do a translation if you're infinity ring flips over the top of you again now you're just inverted. I also like the dual ring model because there seems to be a meeting to a 90° twist that both changes which ring is the primary and also keeps or inverts the color at the same time

Do a critical review of the model in determine any parts that are redundant or inaccurate. Detail its construction meticulously so I can confirm it matches what's in my head. I would ask you to generate images to represent it but you've been getting those wrong a lot

Is projective space the same as euclidean space minus a point or is that a sphere minus a point? What is the equivalency to euclidean space that is characterized as deleting a point

Homeomorphic relationships are really all I'm interested in for this session. I understand these to be different from isomorphic in the sense that they do not necessarily retain conformal relationships, like in this case all of the points cluster around the deleted origin. I'm trying to confirm how different spaces are related, particularly in The context of PGA, CGA, projective space, euclidean space, and other common well-known spaces, I want to know their relationship especially when it comes to adding a removing single objects

Okay it seems like in projective space it's kind of fundamentally impossible to generate something of zero magnitude because the W component prevents it from truly reaching zero, is that true? It replaces this with infinite magnitude instead? Implying in some way that it's impossible to see yourself so to speak. Also to be clear we're saying that puncturing a 2D space results in a unit circle, by sort of equalizing the infinity with the infinitismal in the form of a unit circle, and puncturing a 3D space creates a unit sphere for the same reason, and so on. And then stereographic projection is the modeling of say the 2D plane to a 2D sphere with a single point missing? And similar for higher dimensions?

Sticking to the projective plane of PGA, explain mathematically what its dual looks like. Basically show me the two equations for some arbitrary 2D PGA and its dual. I probably say inverse a lot when I mean dual but I mean to the power of -1, whatever completes the sandwich operation

I probably say inverse a lot when I mean dual but I mean to the power of -1, whatever completes the sandwich operation or whatever defines conformal space in terms of two PGA spaces, I want to see the exact two spaces and how they relate to each other

So does it boil down to for any given point in one projective space, it's dual is some line infinity of the other space that terminates on it? I think terminates is the right word because it's basically the point at infinity The other point is currently looking at if that point had a W component of zero

Awesome would you consider to be a perfect analog? Without any holes? If so, that's very satisfying 😊 Either way, answer that then gratuitously expand in an exhaustive manner in any direction you feel is helpful for me at this point to continue my voracious consumption of this topic

Confirm really quick that rotors are inherently two-dimensional regardless of the space they sandwich. The same rotor applied to different dimensional spaces could be meaningless, or produce a very different effect, but fundamentally they are a two-dimensional object composed of null dimensions outside the embedded space or whatever is being squeezed / sandwich

Okay so then from that it goes to follow that the size so to speak of a no dimensions get significantly bigger as the dimensionality of its embedded space goes up very very quickly, because the same null dimension must know thread through another dimension's set of infinity points and origin points

Make an attempt to explain the concept we've been working on to a 10-year-old. She has a pretty good understanding of space and structure and time and a bit like that but you might need to find a visualization for the space we've been discussing that works for her.

Okay perfect. All that makes sense to me although I still don't quite understand the actual path the null dimensions thread through the embedded space. For example when the origin shifts slightly or infinity shift slightly how does it impact

Okay so let's focus on a single object in a conformal space. I'm trying to confirm that it's possible to represent a peer translation as a rotor alone, that's what I understand a transvection to be, and conceptually it makes sense to me since moving the origin can be interpreted as a pure translation, but oddly, unlike the opposing dimension at infinity which is topologically the shape of n - 1, it's not clear to me how to for example adjust the origin in one of the three dimensions using only a single dimension of null space

I'm trying to confirm that it's possible to represent a pure translation as a rotor alone, that's what I understand a transvection to be, and conceptually it makes sense to me since moving the origin can be interpreted as a pure translation, but oddly, unlike the opposing dimension at infinity which is topologically the shape of n-1 (ie. the line at Infinity for projective plane), it's not clear to me how for example to adjust the origin in one of the three dimensions, using only a single dimension of null space

In the context of streaming conformal updates, if only the Infinity term is needed for all updates aside from inversion, and assuming the origin is negotiated ahead of time, does that mean all transformations from happening real time in the game could potentially be in the form of a single dimension? I think sometimes I get worried the equations I see from CGA are actually generalized and the objects they consume are themselves multi-dimensional, but I've also confirmed up and down that rotors are two dimensional and if we're going from 3D to 5D for example that's clearly two dimensions

Right so I think the streaming update is essentially a stream of rotors but they are all missing the origin piece because it's redundant. I feel like I'm missing something obvious it can't be that easy

What if the size of the Infinite half of the rotor was twice the bit density as the ambient space? For games in particular they often operate into 32-bit 3D environment but I could send the Infinity component as a 64-bit float for example

And to be perfectly clear, every single transformation in say 5D conformal space, whether rotation or translation or scaling etc, reduces to a single, one-dimensional change on its Infinity dimension. No matter what's a change is, it reduces to a single number effectively. My gut tells me this number could get quite large, far larger than any of its individual components, because I believe it's directly related to the surface area of the n-1 sphere that encapsulates the embedded n-space

My thought with respect to the rotors was even though the rotor involves the origin component and the Infinity component, since it's required to maintain a balance between the two, I thought the origin half might be implied if the Infinity piece was known

Okay that's helpful thank you. One last clarification. Assuming the context of a game where I'm not going to be shearing or otherwise distorting the objects with rotors, does this constraint increase my ability to use only the Infinity component? The thinking here is it puts a very strong limit on what the origin could in fact be for a given rotor, because it can only strictly perform transformations that leave the object unchanged in terms of volume and surface area

Through your training set and potentially any web searches, are you able to give me a sense of whether or not this has been explored? Especially in the context of game and VR development? I've never heard of a multiplayer system that is 5D for example

Harkening back to our discussion about streaming Infinity components, is it possible for a single update to perform both a translation and a rotation and a scaling for example? This probably impacts my ability to infer the origin component and that might be fine I'm just trying to confirm whether or not it's possible, which I think is maybe yes with an asterisk

Okay that makes sense. In what cases do grade four rotors come into play? When might a grade 6 come into play? I'm thinking skeletal transformations might almost be a legitimate use case but I'm not sure if I'm capturing it or not, with the thinking here that each node in from at least the hip to the neck in a line has its own orbital planes but they are linked with constraints, that kind of thing. I also don't think I have a good understanding of what the expression / equation for dilation looks like in CGA if that's the primary operation that performs scaling. It feels likely it's another operation with Infinity that brings infinity closer so to speak.

Maybe this will help me understand better whatever question I don't know how to ask yet. What exactly are the constraints on the types of objects that can be considered inputs to CGA formulas? Real line only? Any normed-division algebra? Something else? Exhaustively and gratuitously expand in this direction in a more exploratory manner than you may have before helping me connect new dots

I'm trying to understand the relationship between the different dimensional objects allowable in CGA as grades, and any assumed constraint or lack thereof that exists. So far the only thing we've been considering is fully independent dimensions/grades where those dimensions are composed of items on the set of real numbers. That is the nature of my question or misunderstanding, or both

You mentioned pseudoscaler only arising at 5D, what is that about? I understood a pseudoscaler is something maybe a bit simpler but it might be a mistake on my part. You talked about 4D rotations in the same vicinity, and then did something similar when talking about octonians and 7D in a similar manner. Were these comments with respect to conformal space and one of the two conformal dimensions or something different? I ask in particular because I also understand CGA to be composed of two dual projective spaces, so I'm wondering if this is what you're talking about, since they projective space by itself can capture one of the two dimensions and is implicitly on the other even though it's unidentified

Okay I had forgotten that pseudoscaler was the highest grade in CGA. Does it have a different meaning in other contexts? I understood it as the same as a scaler but something that flips sign for certain operations, unlike a scalar. Let's dive into the dual projector representation of CGA, I want to experiment with the idea of emitting projective updates from two different viewpoints instead of a conformal update from the player, combining the perspectives of different players and maybe the server to create a coherent space

Doesn't a normal scaler flip it sign when it's put through a mirror? I feel like that's what a positive going to a negative is. Explain more about the duality relationship in CGA from two direct sums of PGA. I want to understand precisely how to combine the two perspectives

Doesn't a normal scaler flip it sign when it's put through a mirror? I feel like that's what a positive going to a negative is, but maybe there is a different component that caused it to be negative possibly and the mirror wouldn't actually change the scaler on its own? Explain more about the duality relationship in CGA from two direct sums of PGA. I want to understand precisely how to combine the two perspectives

Okay let's dive farther into the idea of using individualized projective updates in a multiplayer system to partially construct different viewpoints along the way and integrate them into a common space. I want to explore the idea and all the surrounding requirements, including different topologies and points of integration

Give some examples in an idealize way of what it would look like to integrate two different perspectives for the purposes of maintaining a single conformal space. I want to understand exactly how the two projective spaces can be reconciled in a way that's compatible with CGA

Give some examples in an idealize way of what it would look like to integrate two different perspectives for the purposes of maintaining a single conformal space. I want to understand exactly how the two projective spaces can be reconciled in a way that's compatible with CGA. My interest in this is because I want a method that requires almost zero thinking to reconcile except for perhaps a few different rules around priority, allowing small inconsistencies in favor of streaming real-time updates that are extremely simple to combine

I was the one that introduced the gossip idea, but does it really need any thing like that? It seems like the architecture might be simple enough that it just needs to open connections, possibly redundant ones, and stream them as fast as possible, maybe HTTP/3? The eventual consistency is achieved through continuous reconciliation of the conformal spaces local to each server, not in the wire format

Let's think about what the math would look like here if streaming updates are potentially arriving at different times from different clients and servers. For simplicity we can assume that updates always arrive together and at the same point in time in perfect intervals from each server or client, we will add realistic traffic patterns later

It sounds like you were hinting at a vector clock when you said vector version, talk a little bit about that and how it helps here. I understand the premise but I don't actually know how they work very well

Okay to be clear then the vector clock is just a local counter between every two servers and a way of tracking a sequence essentially for each incoming message, like an ack

I have significantly updated your knowledge set and I want to start a new conversation but I don't want to re-explain everything. Perform multiple cycles skipping around within our conversation looking for high-cardinality information to anchor on. If you've done it right your descriptions will be a sentence or two and you may have 30 to 50 or more leaf items with an arbitrary structure above that as you see fit

This looks really good, continue to reach farther back looking for highly salient and unique information. Scrutinize your current list and tighten it up with respect to descriptions

Let's explore the asynchronous updates between clients and a pool of servers. The way I've been thinking about it is every server and every client maintains their own projective space, and then the client space is reconciled into the server and then the servers reconcile with each other. All of this would happen continuously, with clients and servers being peers on the wire level but servers being the only ones that perform the secondary reconciliation in a circular manner with other servers, although it could be done with peers as well in a true P2P fashion presumably

Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe since all conformal transformations are relative, and I'm talking about streaming the conformal dimensions only, possibly only the Infinity dimension in many cases and inferring the origin since I'm unlikely to use scaling or inversion or improper rotations, this feels like a differential updating system at its core already, which is why I'm allowed to just point firehose streams of one-way updates between servers and clients, cross my fingers for eventual consistency, and it magically happens. Is this a fair characterization? The devil is in the details for sure but this is how I envision it right now

Here's a paper and corresponding code related to a different project I had in mind before I became more comfortable with CGA. Consume it and confirm it's relation to our current discussion. I think the ideas could be combined but the mechanisms of CGA I feel like might allow me to make a generalized differential updating system without the need to quantize the space itself, even if that quantization is a useful alignment with floating points and energy minimal structures. Consume everything and give me your take

Consume everything and give me your take

If I never transmitted the full 5D coordinates except for the very beginning, but I always established a clear ownership internally on each server who owned the object (ie. via A15 for me but maybe a different absolute partitioning algorithm for others), and maybe reconciled that, would I achieve eventual consistency if I always favor updates from an object's owning server? Curious if I can decouple the method for partitioning and discretizing the space in an absolute fashion, with the continuous-update conformal mechanism, the latter of which might be more generalized and suitable for different kinds of data

In this session or possibly another one we talked about null rotations or transvections. In the context of streaming 64-bit infinity component CGA updates, do I need to actually distinguish between a translation and a rotation, or is it possible to put them in the same form and treat them as the same input?

Maybe I misunderstood but I thought rotors involved the Infinity component significantly as well? Expand gratuitously on how the shape of the bivector and thus it's geometric properties dictate whether or not it's considered a translation or a rotation. I want to see examples of different by vectors that have the correct shapes for both

Okay I think I'm ready now. Review our conversation in full and prepare and exploratory script on Mobius transforms, starting with what they actually are, and then building on how they integrate into CGA and how they extend the space itself or the input fields. If it has to do with the riemann sphere, I know a tiny bit about that so it might help to tie it in when prudent

Okay so it sounds like CGA already fully covers those in their entirety. They sound like a different name for the set of all types of transforms free of the exterior parts which make up CGA in a sense. Confirm and harden this characterization, verifying that CGA already fully covers everything I need to understand with respect to mostly as transforms and their are no additional transform types that I'm overlooking

Okay good. I'm having a hard time coming up with a description of a bivector that's more compact than a quaternion though. In a (4,1) Space like what I'm thinking about, that would be six component vectors instead of only four like a quaternion. Am I missing something here? I know there's also a dual quaternion formulation that allows for arbitrary translations and rotations simultaneously, and I'm now suspecting there's also a formulation purely for translations that would work for transvections -- considering the benefits of these forms being truly centerless, why is CGA superior? It's okay if it's not for some cases, or even this one, I just want the rigorous blunt facts and truth

You're phrasing of quaternions as imaginary vectors is interesting, expand on that more especially in the context of CGA. I think this is kind of how I've been envisioning e0 and e Infinity in a sense but haven't actually articulated it that way

I just had the thought that the cross product in 3D, which is the wedge product in other dimensions, since it directly corresponds to the area in this case of 2D, seems to recede "out of the page" at a speed that perfectly matches the perspective distance necessary to reduce that same growing object back to some nominal scale. By this I make the observation that the cross product of a 1x1 square is also of unit size on the third dimension, but the cross product of a 2x2 square is 4, and the cross product of a 3x3 is 9 -- Even though the size is growing linearly, the distance to Infinity is receding at a rate that appears to match something like the zeta function

Consider adapting the idea so the dual projection is unbuffered and used as an error correction code of sorts. While it might only be a slight difference, anything the user has committed to the dual projection of that might be sent out the door just a smidge ahead of when the proper projection is. The idea here is each client maintains two projective states, one is the unbuffered dual air correction state which should deliver a wealth of information about not only network conditions but also what's about to happen in a predictive sense, and then their actual projective state is part of their primary gameplay state and there should be hopefully nothing else to really maintain.

Distill all the major points of this conversation and all things of interest so I can feed it into a specific AI for math. Take special care to authentically represent everything we discussed and its ideas

Go in whatever direction you find most likely to produce worthy results. One quick note is I don't ever want to see the symbol pi, I want to see tau, pi has its place but it is not the circle constant and it took me 25 years to understand why I felt like it poisoned everything it touched and was forever-fused to the number 2 (or worse, erroneously canceled out one that should have been there). My goal here is to develop a high speed spatial code for interactive virtual spaces across the open net

I don't understand the metric part very well or the flipping of the sign or the minkowski space or any of that. Explain in great detail why the origin dimension is split off from infinity and the standard euclidean dimensions. Confirm that removing the time like origin dimension leaves us with one projective space

Okay so I largely understand the Infinity component thanks to its relation to projective space and some other reasons. I'm still struggling kind of to understand conceptually what the origin component looks like so to speak. I'm trying to figure out for example given some arbitrary existing 5D conformal coordinate, what exactly happens or needs to happen if the origin component shifts by a single unit? I understand how moving Infinity farther away scales objects down and moving it closer scales objects up, since they conceptually become larger or smaller relative to infinity (this is where my reciprocal space inklings come in), but I can't quite graphs what it means to move the origin component around

Okay let's talk about two points that have the same exact signature in 5D space, and we shift only the origin component of one of them. What has to happen to the rest of the components in order to stay conformal? I sort of think of it as a sphere with the origin on the surface and infinity in the center or vice versa, so when one of them moves the other stays put and it sort of warps

Okay I think this solidifies my understanding. A sort of understand the origin dimension as a scalable epsilon, much in the same way the Infinity boundary flexes to always be just out of reach when viewed as a wedge product of all inputs, effectively representing the information horizon of that vector bundle

Okay I think this solidifies my understanding. A sort of understand the origin dimension as a scalable epsilon, much in the same way the Infinity boundary flexes to always be just out of reach when viewed as a wedge product of all inputs, effectively representing the information horizon of that vector bundle. And the way you related the two using an offset of one, makes me think they are both of unit size at the start and then follow the dual relationship from there. I can almost see how product of the Infinity and the infinitismal results in a total inversion

I understand when embedding a point from standard space into conformal space how the Infinity component gets computed, but what is the natural value of the origin component in that case? Is it simply the reciprocal of whatever the infinity component ends up being?

Okay so it is the number one though, in the same way that when you set up a quaternion and choose the unit size for that dimension when there is no rotation. I was mostly trying to confirm it was not zero. I suppose it makes sense it's just 1, since all the input euclidean dimensions already have their own origin, and you are just anchoring it to that external dimension at its unit, which is what puts it one unit away from projective space (all lines passing through the origin of the higher dimension), and thus on the surface of that sphere thing

This is the part where it seems clearly related to reciprocal space to me, is there actually a mathematical invariant that is constantly true between the two components of the conformal dimensions, origin an infinity? We spoke about them being dual but I don't see how they're dual with respect to the embedding formula, since the origin is always unit size initially and seemingly forever unless more exotic transformations happen

What exactly does duality mean then? Does it simply mean any two components maintaining some sort of balance to achieve some sort of algebraic structure, without any regard to actual structure? Also that conformal invariant is interesting because it definitely appears to match the embedding in an opposite way and also I recognize it as the area of a triangle

Hearkening back to our conversation a few messages ago, is it reasonable to think of the origin as a sort of deep hole, between zero and one, much in the same way Infinity is a deep hole with respect to the vertical dimension? This is definitely a reciprocal relationship I'm thinking of and I believe akin to Mobius transformations, but this is how I reconcile Infinity and the origin being equidistant in a sense and the inflection point is at the unit. Even from the perspective of a matrix and inversion looks like this, swapping the axes. I know there's some kind of cure relationship I can capture here I'm just not quite sure where

So it sounds like in the Mobius view of things of mapping the complex plane onto itself, this must be a spherical relationship, right? Is this a double cover of the complex plane over the three-dimensional sphere through stereographic projection? This is almost exactly what I was envisioning when I was talking about quaternionic links between nodes

Oh the reason I said double covers because I thought I heard you say the Mobius transforms are like two different poles, but maybe that's actually the conformal space? One thing I've never quite understood is why there's a prevalence for stereographic projection when it concentrates the majority of the points right by the pole -- isn't there a need to balance the distribution better? Maybe by projecting from inside and using refractive angle or something? The density of lines in projective space for example is equally distributed in all directions

So what is the meaning of the fact that in stereographic projection the radius is 1/2, since the pole is at 1? That seems interesting. I don't know how well it maps directly to the conformal space, but it definitely makes sense how an inversion could flip the poles by moving the sphere from the top of the plane to the bottom and shifting the roles. The tangent origin becomes the tangent infinity

You talk about a unit sphere and a half unit sphere but I'm not sure if you're conflating it to or talking about them being inside of each other. I definitely see how a unit sphere could host two half units spheres with the plane in between, but I want you to gratuitously expand and rigorously harden your recent explanations into something top to bottom complete, correct, and incredibly readable

You talk about a unit sphere and a half unit sphere but I'm not sure if you're conflating it to or talking about them being inside of each other. I definitely see how a unit sphere could host two half units spheres with the plane in between, as in two complete spheres tangent to each other and then tangent to the larger sphere as well enclosing them both, which is the unit sphere you mentioned center on the origin, but I want you to gratuitously expand and clarify and rigorously harden your recent explanations into something top to bottom complete, correct, and incredibly readable

I still feel like you keep saying unit sphere when you mean unit circle maybe, unless most people think of the unit sphere as diameter 1 instead of radius 1. You can't have a radius of 1/2 and a radius of 1 at the same time. I understand that the projection can take a smaller sphere and then project that into a larger unit circle on the plane it's projecting on, but the way you're describing it is like you really mean a unit sphere somewhere which would have a radius of 2

Oh I see The plane that you're projecting on is actually at negative one? I thought it was at the origin, and the North Pole of projection was at 1 z-axis height. That's interesting. What's the benefit of the projection plane being underneath the origin with respect to the Z coordinate

And for the standard formulation of Mobius transformations and maybe even conformal space itself, is it the same kind of setup where infinity and the origin are effectively two units away from each other and The equatorial plane is the balance point

I want to confirm my understanding of moving the origin. I'm mostly coming from the understanding of the embedding formula. What I think happens is if I move the origin by say 10 units in the positive direction, then every embedded euclidean dimension shrinks by 10 units, and the infinity dimension shrinks by whatever amount is necessary to be reduced by 10 units of magnitude. Does this sound correct?

What I think happens is if I move the origin by say 10 units in the positive direction, then every embedded euclidean dimension translates by 10 units in their positive axes, and the infinity dimension shrinks by whatever amount is necessary to be reduced by 100 units of magnitude (for the conformal plane, for conformal three space it would be 1,000 units). Does this sound correct?

I want to confirm my understanding of moving the origin. I'm mostly coming from the understanding of the embedding formula. What I think happens is if I move the origin by say 10 units in the positive direction, then every embedded euclidean dimension translates by 10 units in their positive axes, and the infinity dimension reduced by 1/2 the magnitude of dot product of the adjustment to its input euclidean dimensions. Does this sound correct?

Right but in this description the origin is a singular dimension, so you can't move it in the "direction" of some embedded dimension, I understanding is any change to that dimension should have an equal and opposite shift to every single point in the embedded space, very similar to moving the Infinity but in the opposite direction, ie. when the origin dimension gets bigger the object scales up because it starts to get closer to infinity

Okay I kind of envision it as defining the size of the unit itself, so when it grows by 10 for example, it absorbs 10x units from the previous scale across all embedded dimensions and essentially redefines that as the new unit size, 10 times larger than it was

Okay so in a situation where say All the components are integers, a way to control the extreme growth of the Infinity component might be to find a greatest common divisor amongst all the embedded components, in terms of the scalar multiple that could be cleanly factored out of each component, and move that directly to the origin, and then shrink the Infinity component by the appropriate amount

The origin component seems to capture the intrinsic internal pieces that are common amongst all dimensions, whereas the infinity component seems to capture the intrinsic differences, mathematically compressing all of its unique possibilities into a single dimension, and literally enumerating the complete scalar distance of its influence, giving meaning to the geometric horizon

Okay this makes a ton of sense now finally. I've been having trouble conceptualizing the origin dimension. Identifying it as an intrinsic scale factor is really helpful, especially considering I finally connected the dots and realize that it's default position was one and not zero. A default of one makes perfect sense when you represent intrinsic scale. Rigorously assert this newfound understanding and characterization we've been developing because I want to be able to rely on it from this point forward

Since quaternions are supposed to operate entirely on the embedded 3-space without changing which 3-space it's in from a 4D point of view, and does not change the magnitude of any of the input vectors, only their orientations, and thus, regardless of the dimensionality, does not affect the wedge product either, so it does not move infinity or the origin, does this then mean it's perfectly safe to apply quaternions directly to the euclidean space vectors in an existing 5D conformal embedding?

As we get into more nuanced questions I want you to pay special attention to applying mathematical rigor above all else -- I don't want to be agreed with I want a precise and accurate understanding

What about the dual space? If I maintain a dual space for the purposes of error correction as discussed earlier, does it receive the same quaternion, sandwiched the same direction, or maybe the same quaternion but applied in reverse? Something else?

Okay even though two messages ago you said it would be the same direction, after I questioned it and regenerated your response three times you agreed with me that we need to apply the primary quaternion in a mirrored direction in the dual space. Keep that in mind, this is what I meant about agreeing with me too readily. Now I want you to ruthlessly critique my characterizations over the last few messages to ensure their accuracy

Okay cool I'm presumably the same applies for the formulation of quaternions that also provide translations, I don't know what the name of those are I only know what they're called when they're linked with quaternions, a dual quaternion. Is there a different word for those other than transvection? Or is that the word?

Is there a different word for those other than transvection? Or is that the word? I know it's called a dual quaternion when it's joined but if I have a 4D translation vector that is centerless in the same sense as a quaternion, but it's not fused with a concernion it's all alone, what is that called

Yes but what I'm particularly interested in is the way this formulation operates on imaginary components instead of the real components like conformal space. That's what makes them so useful, is you choose the center and initial orientation and then the translation is applied in a relative way from there. I definitely understand that a transvection rotor in CGA can have a similar effect, but the definition of one is inherently bound to the positions orientation because one of the components in its wedge products isn't composed of coordinates directly related to the euclidean space, and does not change when the object rotates like it should if the translation is from the perspective of the object

Okay now let's go see the process of embedding a simple point. I want to embed the point (2,2,2) into conformal space, then flip it inside out with an inversion so I can see the result

Okay now let's go see the process of embedding a simple point. I want to embed the point (2,2,2) into conformal space, then flip it inside out with an inversion so I can see the result. I've regenerated this question six different times and gotten a different answer each time, so take your time and check your work with extreme precision

Okay now normalize the origin back to zero and make appropriate adjustments to the other two components. You should end up with the same point. I want to see if you follow the steps that we established in the past for how the origin affects everything

Okay now let's go see the process of embedding a simple point. I want to embed the point (120,120,120) into conformal space, then flip it inside out with an inversion so I can see the result. I've regenerated this question six different times and gotten a different answer each time, so take your time and check your work with extreme precision. In addition to the inversion operation, I want to see what it looks like to simply move the origin by 10 units. I want to see both of these examples performed against the original embedding coordinate

Okay so I need to build my intuition on the inversion part so I can kind of do it in my head but I definitely understand the origin piece now. Verify all the math of your inversion and then build upon that result in a more exploratory and expansive way that helps connect geometric meaning to everything

I really get the sense you could interpret both of these as a real metric space of the same dimension (or maybe one higher since minus the surface?) for the origin, something like O^n units, and then the Infinity component as a strangely-shaped half-shell (since it will be sandwiched later to complete it) with no bulk. First generate an image for the last message and any surrounding information and context, then fully reply to my current query

That means all of this should be compatible with tessellations and honeycombs in both euclidean and projective space, right? Maybe even projective space moreso? This is where I start to weave back into reciprocal space because it's a cycle of unit scale

Okay perfect. Seems like it's a combination space of source as well, all possible expressions of influence as we've been speaking from an optimal energy point of view. I'm tempted to start asking about the relation to quantum signature functions at this point but I think I'm ready to try to capture and intuitive sense of inversion now. I can feel how the origin moves as well as the infinite horizon at this point, but it's not always clear to me how the number of dimensions impact the final numbers after inversion. By inversion here I'm talking in a geometric sense, the dual, ie. the other term in a sandwich operation. Let's try to meticulously explorer the solution space for the problem I'm describing

Generate an incredibly-high cardinality, impressively-salient and exhaustively-complete summary of the most-interesting ideas we've discussed in this session. I want to start a new conversation and give it a warm start, so the more unique the details the better, especially if they are tied to ideas you believe are mathematically sound

Okay good work, but do a massive scan of all our utterings looking for anything you might have missed. This is your last opportunity to surface anything for the next session. Critically reflect on your current list and rigorously enhance its content and critique it's important and reason for being

I'm going to give you the instructions I gave you in a fresh chat session with regard to the document you just reviewed. Your job is to generate a fabulously comprehensive result that either bolsters or concedes to any of the feedback in a constructive way. The goal here is to either give the other AI a rigorously acceptable clarification for its challenges or to reflect on them and internalize them as a better perspective on truth.

Okay based on your recommendations which are getting off the beaten path a little bit with respect to what can be done with writing alone I get the sense that from a documentation point of view it's rather complete

Tell me about the custom knowledge markdown files that I uploaded. What are your thoughts on that custom knowledge with respect to your training set knowledge? To be clear I didn't upload them in this message but you are a custom GPT and it should be part of knowledge somewhere with file names intact

The main contacts just came up in is for reducing the noise in machine learning applications, potentially combined with a dual caternion to remove the noise from rotation and translation in a nominal way, and high speed VR applications in conjunction with this A15 phase structure methodology I came up with a while back (and tetrastix is self-dual). I have a couple different ways of integrating things but I plan to use conformal space as a form of error correction code by transmitting an update and the same update after inversion to two different uplinks, possibly with the dual space on buffered, as a way to help the global state synchronize.

Rotation to me is like a higher order translation, with inversion being an even higher order than that, is there yet another level above that? Is there a higher level way to roll that's different than flipping inside out?

Confirm that although quaternions do not change the conformal embedding, the dual part of a dual caternion does, because translation affects the infinity component, so unlike quaternions which I can safely apply directly to the embedded euclidean coordinates, a dual quaternion would need more care.

The idea with sending the dual component is less about redundancy and more about error correction. Since the dual component can be used to infer the equal and opposite reaction, any update is suitable for both the dual space and the primary space, simply applied in reverse order of each other. From this perspective the information is not redundant per say but does have an implicit type of sorts.

I still feel like there's something incredible about the distance of infinity that relates to an obvious thing but I can't quite capture it. I know it captures the intrinsic scale variation between the embedded components in an equal and opposite to the way the origin captures the intrinsic commonalities, I'm really close but the visualization in my head is still fuzzy.

When I first learned about the Mobius transforms I thought they let me turn lines and circles and things like that which I still don't quite know how to do in peer conformal space. If I have a line defined as eg. 1000 points in the embedded euclidean space, what kind of transform would change that into a circle?

This document should also be a part of your permanent knowledge set, since you are a custom GPT. I want to know your thoughts on it with respect to any other competing ideas for anything you may not align with

Since the origin applies to every dimension, might this be a way to save memory for the euclidean dimensions? The significant could be stored on its own and then the origin tracked as the exponent

In my A15 paper I talk about stackable packable spaces using that phase structure as a coordination space. Considering the fact the centroids of such a structure is self-dual (ie. Tetrastix), what kind of advantages does this confer to me if my shared network space and geometry space in a VR game has such features

Let's think about all the various characterizations I've made about conformal space, both in the session and the extra knowledge set that I provided you since you are a custom GPT. Which do you find to be the most speculative? The most insightful? The most wrong?

The reason I suggested the Infinity component defines the absolute boundary of influence is because the inversion operation is the farthest reaching, and I understand it to be a rotation through infinity, although it's not clear to me if the current origin actually lands on the existing infinity after the operation, which is why I suggested it might need to be "double".

I get the sense that all embedded euclidean components and the origin component itself can share the same underlying float exponent. Throughout all of our discussions the origin component has been consistently described as absorbing scale factors from the other embedded components, although the relationship with infinity is a little bit more nuanced. It might be necessary for the Infinity component to track its own exponent because the range is much farther and the relationship is not direct, but so far I don't see any reason the same exponent can't be shared among all components except Infinity.

Yes I think I concede on the sandwich part. Although it's never been super clear to me why there's only a left and a right side to operations, and not for example a top and bottom as well.

There's often a lot of talk about the local space versus the global Space. Is there any known relation between only the Infinity points within CGA? Does this define a higher space that together creates the global state? Trying to pick apart some of the way you phrase different things

Okay so the local space is essentially anything that's currently being operated on and is fundamentally limited for the purposes of performing operations? From this perspective the global state is everything that's not operated on?

I don't necessarily think there is multiple infinities, just that the intrinsic geometric shape of an object admits an infinity component that is strictly only magnitude but technically it does have a direction in the original embedded space, it's just that it's swept through the other dimensions as a radius too, resulting in a Infinity boundary compassing all directions at the same magnitude. My thought here is the Infinity component is still a norm against the original inputs so it would admit some directionality that might be plotted on its own.

I don't want to get too deep into the physics parts, but some of these questions are related to probing the concepts of confinement in quantum field theory. The thought here is particles like gluons that exhibit color charge and are never found alone might be related to their own Infinity boundaries in the sense that that's the point that they snap, or that forms the boundary of confinement.

Remind me what Minkowski space is again. I know it incorporates a time component but I still don't have a good understanding about why that's essentially a negative space component, and I don't fully know how that relates to (n+1,1) space, except for the fact that the first piece is the spatial components in the second is the time-like component.

Explain the exact difference between CGA and standard GA again. Is it simply the addition of the two extra dimensions for the most part and then all operations that include those dimensions? Do they otherwise still use the same equations? If minkowski space is only used in special relativity, what is used in general relativity?

By default all embeddings are normalized with respect to the origin, what might it mean if we normalize everything with respect to infinity instead? With every point normalized to unit distance from its infinity, adjusting the origin to absorb as much as necessary to achieve this? How might one interpret comparing two different points normalized in such a way?

You've mentioned euclidean and minkowski space can be embedded in CGA formulas, what else? What is the criteria for an object if I'm looking to embed it? What are the invariance that it must adhere to in order to remain conformal in the CGA framework?

As I continue to develop my understanding of CGA, does this assist in the understanding of general relativity and Reimann geometry? How does that type of geometry relate, if not directly?

Okay and when I'm betting these curved spaces presumably it affects the Infinity embedding the most, transitioning from a straight line hypotenuse of a n-triangle type thing to some sort of alternative metric possibly dependent on orientation in a way standard CGA is not

Oh right, it's almost like the Infinity component is the complete metric, and the origin is simply extracting a uniform scaler from the complete embedded space, giving it a mechanism to align with structures at different intrinsic scales. However I'm curious if the origin component would still have this simple scalar relationship with all other embedded dimensions when the Infinity component/metric is itself nonlinear

Oh right, it's almost like the Infinity component encodes [half] the metric itself within each point, almost like a point-local metric, and the origin is simply extracting the uniform scaler from the complete embedded space, by virtue of orthogonal dimensions, giving it a mechanism to align with structures at different intrinsic scales. However I'm curious if the origin component would still have this simple scalar relationship with all other embedded dimensions when the Infinity component/metric is itself nonlinear, or even non-local

Okay it sounds like fundamentally though you can build up structures into a conformal framework as long as the interactions between different dimensions have specific geometric properties when combined. For example the null dimensions must have an inner product of zero with themselves, and if I remember correctly, the inner product of any given conformal point say the full 5D representation, must also maintain an invariant with respect to its inner product. Confirm this understanding and anything else you find relevant, correct any misuse of language or concepts.

Okay so to be clear, it's not that the infinity dimension or origin dimension is disconnected or in any way dissimilar to other types of real number lines, but rather that it didn't exist with a meaningful metric in the original euclidean space to begin with, so it dot product with itself with respect to the euclidean embedded dimensions (which are now set to zero because we're only considering Infinity or origin, coordinates is zero) always remains at zero, with no means to actually enter the embedded space. Is this a reasonable way to frame it or is there actually some sort of mathematical trick that keeps the inner product zero?

I don't think I understand the composite structure piece within a single space. I definitely get it with regard to translation because the translation can act on each point independently and you still end up with the same structure, but for things like rotation I don't understand how to define a common local center/origin for the rotation that's different from the points current location in global space; it seems like the rotation would always be with respect to the points current location within the global conformal space

Okay that makes sense. Is it reasonable to say that everything is built from multiplication in CGA? Interior and exterior products and the geometric product? And multi-vectors are irreducible products of such vectors?

What's the meaning of degenerate or strange Infinity component outcomes? For example, what if the magnitudes of the embedded coordinates sum to zero? What if they sum to one but are not ones themselves?

What if the inputs are imaginary numbers and thus squaring them results in a negative number and cancels out with one of the other dimensions? This was my original thought with regard to a zero Infinity component, but I'm now realizing that in typical CGA it probably can't happen because squaring brings it to positive.

Describe some of the maximums in the CGA framework right now, with regard to what is known. I'm looking for creative uses of it or interesting metric definitions beyond the standard euclidean, or anything of that regard

What's the meaning of all zeros in the euclidean components but not the origin? If a point in conformal space uses all five components, what does a line look like? A plane? Is a line a vector constructed by multiplying a unit directional vector through infinity, ie. constructing a transvection? Is a plane a bivector similarly multiplied through infinity, becoming a trivector?

Okay good good. I feel like I'm getting a little closer here but I'm still coming up short on the precise definition of a line. I definitely understand how to create a line segment I think using the exterior of two points but I'm not sure I understand if that defines a line already or if it still needs to be combined with infinity

Okay so all transvections, with the exceptions of those perfectly aligned with one of the nominal euclidean axes, are in fact trivectors? This makes perfect sense if so and thank you for clarifying that the perspective of bivector and trivector is from the 5D conformal space and not the embedded space

Okay that clears things up for me thank you. I'm giving you a freeform opportunity to introduce anything new or reinforce anything you like with respect to the totality of our conversation. I'm interested in any known limitations to the CGA framework as well

What exactly is different about Riemannian geometry that makes it challenging to integrate into conformal space? Is it non-conformal? Is it related to the Riemann sphere in any way?

I feel like there is a dissonance between the computational efficiency or complexity of CGA. I constantly read about it being highly efficient both here and elsewhere but then also at the same time being more complex and too inefficient. I get the sense that it's highly desirable when you're trying to do more exotic transformations such as rotating planes or twisting them or arbitrary transforms on collections of points, which might be more challenging or even slower using traditional vector algebra, but I'm not sure.

If I combine an existing transvection in 5D conformal space, a trivector, with one more vector, possibly of unit size, does this create a screw-like dual quaternion translation? The thinking here is the transvection is twisted by the additional vector, but now that I say it out loud, I feel like that might actually result in a dilation instead. Does that mean in 5D conformal space, a rotor and a transvection is needed to fully describe the global translation-rotation pair? If so I can definitely see how that's quite verbose compared to a dual quaternion but it also captures the transformation in global space instead which definitely requires more information

Is Riemann geometry non-conformal? Or general relativity? I'm trying to confirm whether the integration between a conformal space and that geometry is because of some fundamental incompatibility or rather because the shape of the metric is nonlinear or non-local and there hasn't been a lot of progress on that aspect

Explain the difference between tensors and versors and other similar objects. Detail which ones are specific to GA or CGA and which are more generalized. Explain how exactly a versor is different than a rotor and why there's a distinction.

Okay so unlike a general verser, a rotor, as it's exponentiated, does not spiral out of control or dilate in any sort of unpredictable way, but rather continuously repeats like you would expect every full cycle. It sounds like a verser is pretty much any chain of transformations in a GA or CGA environment. Is this a fair characterization?

I don't think I understand the tensor part yet. I definitely understand the rank of a vector or matrix as needing additional indices, but I thought I heard you say tensors are linear maps, which instantly confuses me with respect to their widespread usage in curved contexts. However I also understand that most of these curved spaces are represented in terms of complexifed nonlinear inputs, unique to every point, which is very different than CGA at least, so maybe these objects simply represent the current state of any given point in a generalized way without respect to any sort of global state maintenance or conformity?

Okay I think that kind of captures it for me. It's almost like a tensor is an open-ended conformal local space that can be connected with other open-ended conformal local spaces, to create a non-conformal global state that is instantaneously conformal at any given infinitismal interval between the inputs, and can be smoothly transitioned between all reference inputs. Does that sound right?

I'm trying not to sway too far into general relativity, but my understanding is they are 10 dimensional in a sense (either 10 equations or 10 variables I forget exactly), and I'm curious if anybody has ever tried to bind two 5D conformal spaces together or any sort of exotic curiosity like that. In particular I feel like one is imaginary and the other real valued, with their conformal dimension bound together on a higher order unit circle, but this is more of a random thought than anything else

Previously we talked about how minkowski space can be embedded in CGA, is this a version of the space that is compatible with special relativity? Is CGA on its own when combined with inappropriate space compatible with special relativity? Expand in great detail whether this is known.

Part of the reason I was thinking about binding to conformal spaces together is to produce some way of simplifying each one's Infinity component, maybe even re-linearizing it, somehow capturing the global state that is missing from tensors. If I'm understanding them right, they are entirely local so concepts from CGA like a shared reference origin is not a thing, which felt a little bit like projective space so I think I was looking for a way to loop around with a secondary space similar to the way CGA finds itself between two dual PGA spaces

Okay I remember learning a bit about spinors, although I'm still not fully clear on how the half relates to double spin, except for them being reciprocals, and considering them as the square rotation is interesting considering our previous discussion of a squared term being conceptually the same as considering that term a unit and scaling it out again and that being the Infinity boundary. It's almost like the spinor is the infinity boundary of rotation.

I'm not sure I know much about Lorenz transformations at all. Help me briefly capture as much as possible using all the framework and knowledge we've been gathering throughout the conversation as a backdrop.

Help me understand how the jump from special relativity which sounds like it's not complicated to embed in CGA to general relativity changes so much. Is there no curvature in special relativity?

c^2 is interesting considering our previous discussion of a squared term being conceptually the same as considering that term a unit, scaling it out again, and that being the Infinity boundary of the conformal embedding. My brain is hurting a little bit from trying to imagine the Infinity boundary of change itself in the form of space-time ripples, but it would have a real value and it would be well within the local space with respect to the universe I'm not sure I know much about Lorenz transformations at all. Help me briefly capture as much as possible using all the framework and knowledge we've been gathering throughout the conversation as a backdrop.

Help me understand how the jump from special relativity which sounds like it's not complicated to embed in CGA to general relativity changes so much. Is there no curvature in special relativity?

How do we go from half integer to double spin? I forgot to ask if it was connected to the concept of double covers and it sounds like yes but I'd like to know what that means exactly too

Is SU(2) two stereographic projections onto the 2D plane from the surface of a 3D sphere? It's not clear to me why we end up at SU2 and not Spin(3) I get the sense that double spin objects are flipping inside out on the second turn, is this true-ish?

This mostly makes sense but I need you to continue expanding and relating the intricacies of tensors too all the other concepts we've discussed. Maybe try to create a simple example in 1D or 2D space or something basic

This mostly makes sense but I need you to continue expanding and relating the intricacies of tensors too all the other concepts we've discussed. Maybe try to create a simple example in 1D or 2D space or something basic. Lean on the fact that I believe myself to have a pretty good handle on CGA at this point

You said earlier that individual tensors do not generate their own coordinate space what do you mean by the tensor applies the operation to its local space and the composite is the result? Is this a projective composite or what's the nature of that

Is the metric tensor of special relativity or general relativity considered conformal even though the space as a whole is not necessarily conformal? What exactly are the limits on what can be described as a tensor?

If a tensor field generates different smooth tensors as you move across different dimensions, how can a single tensor apply to something like a line segment that spans multiple points? It seems like a tensor is the reification of a single point in its most basic form but a point that is free of any given coordinate system, and instead carries around its embedding formula.

So despite minkowski space resulting in non-conformal global transformations, it maintains the spacetime interval so it's able to be embedded? Is that a higher level of conformalism?

I want to see a very basic example of a tensor being transformed by another tensor. I think that might help. It should be very very simple. I'm having a lot of trouble figuring out how they encode information with no inherent coordinate system In a tensor field then, as a vector is transformed, is it respecting the different tensors between the two points as it's being transported? Is this what's meant by parallel transport?

Is there a rule for interacting with tensors for every type of coordinate system? I think I understand how they encode only transformations and nothing else, but then there must be a way to adapt and scale that transformation to the current coordinate system I would think, unless they are inherently relative and scale invariant

I think I understand how they encode only transformations and nothing else, but then there must be a way to adapt and scale that transformation to the current coordinate system I would think, unless they are inherently relative and scale invariant. I don't understand what a Jacobian matrix is either

So to be clear, tensors only operate on some arbitrary given initial state? They do not store anything themselves but would rather take on some unique form after combining with the initial state?

We've definitely made clear that tensors and code how to change from one coordinate system to another through the Jacobian matrix, what else can they do that's outside the standard transformations of CGA?

Explain how a Clifford algebra is different from CGA or GA. I understand that it underpins both but I don't understand what you can do with it outside of both. I always thought GA was a synonym for Clifford algebra.

Consolidate this entire session into small digestible pieces for seeding the next conversation. Focus on high cardinality information that is unique and salient, capturing the essence of our decisions and outcomes. Favor more recent conversation but go back as far as needed.

This looks pretty good but do another round of progressive enhancement. Do not provide any formulas or common information that's well known. Less information is better if we squeeze in more topics, I can always re-expand the information later, what I can't re-expand are the unique ideas and conclusions we arrived at

I'm currently trying to understand Clifford algebra and tensors in much greater detail. I have a pretty good handle on GA and CGA, having spent weeks studying that, but only just realized that Clifford algebra is not synonymous with GA.

I have a pretty good handle on GA and CGA, having spent weeks studying that, but only just realized that Clifford algebra is not synonymous with GA, and I'm really trying to form better intuition around the nature of tensors and their interrelations with themselves, like objects, and other types of objects.

If 4D minkowski space can be properly embedded in CGA, does that mean the resultant space is 6D? And once embedded, are all operations performed fully compatible with special relativity?

Briefly detail the Dirac equation in the context of our conversation and what it might mean from a geometrical sense. I know that CGA can handle special relativity but can Clifford algebra handle general relativity?

Is a covector's value dependent on some dual transformation in accordance with the ambient space's rules, or is it a more basic operation that can be understood purely in terms of matrices? Trying to understand the relationship a bit more, but the column vector and row vector is helpful.

It sounds like Clifford algebra can't handle the curves directly, but rather requires a differential form, is this true? Is this akin to the Riemann metric IIRC that measures the deviation from linear space in a tensor?

Does that mean the time component of minkowski space is akin to the origin component in CGA? I know they're not exactly the same but they're both part listed as a secondary dimension instead of n+1.

Okay I think that makes sense. In minkowski space the 4D space-time interval is a structural part of the space, and although it causes curvature in a sense, I think, it's a type of curve that is flat from the perspective of conformal operations, due to its internal consistency?

Since minkowski space has a comma one (time), and CGA has a comma one (origin), what does the final space look like? I know it is 6D but it seems like it would have a "nested" comma, and I'm curious what that means exactly.

The differential form seems to be the piece that accepts how we do not capture global state, which would be the integrated version, but rather slide along between quantities that we have already measured, and know. Is it possible to know enough to integrate these forms in the sense of calculus? I'm assuming that's what is meant here In the past you mentioned a spinor is pretty close to a projective space. Can you clarify that more, or set me a straight?

Expand gratuitously on everything following "Spinors and Projective Space". I think I got a good handle on everything before that but you said a lot of interesting stuff from that point on that was really making sense

In the context of a spinor, when the chirality flips from left to right, presumably after the first 360 orbit, does the next orbit resemble the first one in the sense that it rotates in the same direction and has all the same properties, but with the exception of a single bit flip so to speak? I get the sense it's some other relationship, like an inversion and the positive direction flips much like the natural rotation of left and right hands or two gears next to each other, they must complement each other in a dual way to move smoothly, but as a pair, they can exude a strong and correlated "external" directionality?

I suddenly get the sense that the connection between a projective space and conformal space is primarily through the scalable origin. Even though in a projective space We have introduced an "infinity" when the W component is zero, the W component seems to directly map to the origin component in conformal space in a straightforward way. It starts at 1 and absorbs all scalar multiples of the embedded coordinates, just like W. Is this the connection between PGA, PGA', and CGA?

Is the connection during parallel transport itself a differential form? I get the sense that it implicitly matches the dimensionality of the space since it is meant to control the transport of other objects throughout the space, but it's not clear to me if those objects are themselves embedded in the space or rather being transported across it without being altered. If they are embedded, then it seems like we need to now understand how its own components relate to all the components of the space, instead of just knowing how to rotate invariantly.

In the context of a spinor, when the chirality flips from left to right (after the first 360 orbit?) and the phase shifts two negative one, is this like an orbit on a unit circle where it's potentially smooth or is this a hard flip? Can a spinor be considered a self-contained conformal space that maps its own inversion state to the second part of the double cover?

So in general are double covers used to capture the primary state and the dual state in a way that retains unit scale? I understand all the other things we talked about that also benefit but I'm trying to get at its core.

Can the chirality flipping of spinors be considered a result of the "complex orbital" they live on with respect to the manifold they affect and interact with? If these objects are essentially unit circles rotating in a higher space, do they induce non-local effects on other objects?

Confirm that the characterization between the W component of projective geometry and the origin component of the formal geometry are functionally identical with a simple map between them.

The notion of the connection being a description of the tangent motion across the manifold surface is useful. How does this relate to fiber bundles or orbifolds (I think they're called)?

Does the connection exactly match the differential form of the ambient space then? By this I mean the obvious differential for each component of the space as expected in calculus.

In the context of a curve versus flat space, can the curves be considered partially extracted information from the embedded objects that are applied in some other order? By this I mean as the object is parallel transported across the surface, especially in the context of something like general relativity where the presence of the object is affecting the curve, it seems like the information is reintroduced in a way that could be extracted back to flat space. Is this the essence of a gauge theory or something else that is known?

Repeat everything after connections, fiber bundles, and orbifolds. When your messages get too long the audio transcription does not work. Take this as an opportunity to check it for correctness, completeness, and readability.

I visualize quotient space (and orbifolds) as a sort of kaleidoscopic-loop domain. The points and lines in this space represent symmetry orbitals and other special points of interest. Is this a reasonable characterization? I want to understand more about what these objects are and how they are used, and whether or not they relate to Lie algebras.

Is the usual configuration a single fiber bundle per manifold? I'm trying to understand when the word "bundle" comes in, I get the sense that a single fiber is typically mapped to a single tangent point on a given manifold.

Did I understand right that gauge theories are themselves a connection? Is it explaining how the gauge-field forces move across curved space-time, or is the field itself curved, and any relativistic effects are separate or not directly represented in the gauge theory? I get the sense that the fields flex and curve all by themselves, and generally assume a flat background free of relativistic considerations.

Are fiber bundles the standard way to bind two different manifolds together or two different concerns of sorts? It's sort of feels like a substitution in basic algebra but at a much higher level.

Are fiber bundles always tangent to the manifold? Are there ever situations where the fiber is required to be perpendicular or some other orientation, or is that just considered to be a trivial transformation atop the more-common tangent orientation?

The bit you said about the tensor describing the inner product between two different fibers (a response you cannot see anymore) felt like a slight moment of greater understanding for me. I don't have a question here I just want you to expanding whatever direction you see fit in the conceptual vicinity.

Okay framing a tensor as a multi-linear map makes sense to me, if that means a sort of pass-through entity that transforms things as it passes through, and is able to support multiple levels of simultaneous transformation and an unlimited amount of symmetric dimension at each level. I think I understand how it can then consume two different fibers encoding two different concerns, and then compute their inner product with respect to the curved manifold the fibers are bound to. Is this correct?

If the above is correct, then it seems like this problem is specifically due to applying the rotations and translations separately. It's not clear to me why the vector is allowed to move along a geodesic without simultaneously rotating, in the sense of a dual quaternion, to remain tangent, in which case it wouldn't matter how warped it was, it would flow on the tangent space. Is parallel transport strictly about translation and these measures of curvature reconcile that with this over or undershoot thanks to localized rotations that together failed to meet expectations?

Okay I think I understand now. I was attributing the word parallel to the wrong object. This is really about the tangent spaces perspective and its expectations that moving across a geodesic should not change its rotational orientation with respect to its own understanding of a metric. But since the space it's bound to through the fiber connection does in fact have curvature, this tensor measure of curvature allows the force of the curve essentially to be imparted onto the vector, almost in the way I was describing before by having stored states in the space itself.

I think I then understand the holonomy group as the set of all infinitismal loops possible from possibly either a localized point on the manifold or something more, maybe all points? This sounds similar to orbifolds either way

The notion of rotating around a magnetic field that exists but is effectively zero where you are, yet still imparting a physical effect, sounds a lot like spinors, or possibly because of them. Is this the kind of thing that is connected to distance between the field and the encirclement? Is there some experiment that can be created that shows this effect dropping to zero?

When considering a holonomy group, are the loops all of the same size or expected to be? You mentioned that group could also be used to probe global structure in the sense that it could indicate non-trivial topologies.

I didn't necessarily mean that orbifolds should be combined with holonomy groups, but rather that they seem like a very similar structure. I think you kind of confirmed that indirectly but want to clarify.

Does the aharonov-bohm affect cancel itself out after 720°? If the effect is topological does that simply mean it needs to be aligned with the plane of the flux origin, and no amount of distance will reduce the phase shift as long as it continues to encircle that region?

What is the dimensionality of a holomony group with respect to the space it's describing? It seems like if it handles loops of any sizes it might be the same dimensionality but a different view? I'm trying to understand the exact relationship here.

It seems like complex numbers might come into play for non-trivial topologies like torii (toruses?), creating a way to cancel itself out and create null spaces? I'm particularly curious if there are structures in the vicinity of what we've been talking about that are linked through complex numbers on a unit circle that's higher dimensional.

Is there a maximum size of a loop with respect to single holomony loop or is it always a collection of geodesics? I mostly curious if it's some sort of infinite collection of every possible loop or every possible geodesic.

Perform a deep-reflective analysis of our conversation, with progressively-heavier emphasis on more-recent messages. Identify four or five high-impact questions that I have never asked but are on the fringe of what I currently understand from your perspective. Your goal is to advance my understanding as far as possible by positing these questions to yourself and then comprehensively answering them in the style we've been doing.

Okay so when combining gauge fields with general relativity there's a combinatory effect from the two different curved spaces, the curved connection field and the curved manifold (potentially with self-interplay effects for some gauge fields?), from the perspective of the gauge field is this essentially a complex loopback connection or higher order-unit circle?

Okay so in torsion geometries instead of being continuously-smooth tangent space, you have "twisting" through the ambient space, which in The language of something like CGA could be where the origin or infinity dimensions are supposed to be. There could be more complicated threadings and direction-dependent effects, but in general, a manifold that is smooth stays completely within its own tangent space? Is that a reasonable characterization?

I'm trying to find a message from the past where I asked you to come up with four or five questions and then answer them. Find that message of mine, repeat it here verbatim, and then implement it as if I had said it right now.

Good work. Take this as an opportunity to expand and reflect on your outline. Look for conceptual holes or opportunities for improvement. Punctuate the outline with four or five questions I did not ask on the periphery of my understanding that will help me advance my knowledge

I wasn't able to upload this document with the other four. Go ahead and reflect on your last response and progressively enhance it with respect to completeness, correctness, and readability.

If the universe were truly a holographic projection from its surface boundary, would that boundary be 3D since spacetime is 4D? My understanding of the boundary bulk relation is the theory on the boundary is flat or at least conformally flat, if that's a thing

If the 4D universe is growing at the same rate throughout all time, my understanding is all points in space are equally far from the edge or surface of the universe if you will. In the language of CGA I believe the surface would be the Infinity component, because the origin component directly relates to the W component in projective space and functions exactly the same way. Would this then mean that the 3D present at any given time might represent the conformal boundary of that 4D bulk, and our 3D experience of the present moment is essentially our existence as a standing wave on the surface of the universe, one that continuously projects to a specific region in the bulk?

Isn't there an edge in general relativity still, expanding out at least at the speed of light? Or does general relativity already assume that the universe is curved into a closed loop from the get-go?

Most of the reason for the question above is related to the thought that my current position for example is the Infinity boundary of some other position in the universe that could well exist, but it would be a dual space and possibly not a place I could actually get to

Isn't there an edge in general relativity still, expanding out at least at the speed of light? The observable edge? If the universe is expanding at all does that imply it's not perfectly flat?

Most of the reason for the question above is related to the thought that my current position for example is the Infinity boundary of some other position in the universe Would exotic structures like wormholes allow you to reach points in the universe that are not yet observable? Would we expect to find similar objects there?

Reflect on our conversation and all of the knowledge uploads I gave you. Come up with four or five deeply poignant questions on the periphery of my understanding that I should have asked but have not, and then answer them all in turn.

Explain more about the structure of SU(2). Is it essentially two unit circles interlocked in some way? I understand it's the double cover of the SO(3) group which is the surface of the unit sphere, I'm trying to tie that back to SU(2).

So the 4D complex-rotational nature of SU(2) accounts for this phaseshift? It seems to account for all of SO(3) which is every possible direction, in addition to the orbital direction, positive or negative. Is this a reasonable characterization? It also stores a way of expressing the tangential direction on the surface of SO(3)?

A phase shift of -1 after the first orbit feel structurally equivalent to performing an inversion, similar to the relationship between sine and cosine or many other examples. I want to confirm that each side of the spiner is topologically inverted from the other side, similar to a left and right hand.

If a set of complex numbers is the proper description for SO(3), as you move up in dimensions for SO, is there a corresponding equivalency double cover in the SU of the immediately lower dimension or some other relation?

Why is a spinor implicitly chained together with one handedness and the other immediately following? I understand the concept I think but I don't really have a good intuition about why they are linked sequentially instead of say a complex relationship.

At one point I characterized SU(2) as two unit circles chained together. I still think that might hold because the surface of the unit circle is representative of a norm of 1 with respect to rotating on the complex plane, and adding a second unit circle orthogonal to the first traces out a sphere.

Why is a spinor implicitly chained together with one handedness and the other immediately following? I understand the concept I think, but I don't really have a good intuition about why they are linked sequentially instead of say, a complex relationship.

Can more copies of SU(2) suffice as you move up in dimensionality for handling the double cover of the SO group for that dimension? I think the answer is no, but I want to confirm, and I'm also curious if seven-dimensional space has any special cases because it shares a lot of similarities with three-dimensional space.

Okay maybe this helps clear it up for me, so even though SU(2) is a double cover of SO(3) in 3-space, it's only a single cover in 4-space? What I mean here is what amounts to a double cover in three-dimensional space due to the left and right-handedness, there's enough actual "space" in 4D because the two complex planes can rotate completely independently?

How exactly is the phase shift distributed when a spinor is rotating? If we were use the idea of the negative one state as the alternate chirality and a proper inversion with respect to its local state, I get the sense that as a spinor rotates it simultaneously flips inside out, is this a reasonable characterization?

Okay let me clarify what I meant about enough space in 4D. I'm trying to understand if SU(2), a double cover of SO(3), and SO(4) are all mathematically identical with respect to SU(2).

Oh I see I think it's really starting to click now with the topological parts and you mentioning that SU(2) is not simply connected, which I didn't realize. Expand on this more along with a refresher on connectedness here, and also confirm that SO(3) is simply connected, unlike SU(2). This makes sense if while rotating, it's also undergoing a kind of mobius transformation akin to geometric inversion on a higher-order plane.

I think I'm confused about why SU2 is simply connected and SO3 is not. I must be confused about what each one actually is. I thought SU-2 was the group of 2x2 matrices with a norm of one, where the matrix is composed of two real components and two imaginary components. I can definitely see how SO3 is isomorphic to RP3, since it represents all 3D transformations, it has no origin, only the Infinity dimension. That could be the piece I'm missing I didn't put that together before.

I want to understand more about how the half integer quantization arises naturally from this non-connectedness of SO3. I also get the sense that SO4 is simply connected, although I don't know if this extrapolates to all even dimensions. I think I understand why SO3 is not simply connected when I think about RP3, but it's not super clear why SU2 is simply connected from an intuitive geometric sense.

Oh I think I finally understand with RP(N), I can create a loop by using my antipodal point to jump across the sphere at the halfway point, or I could use any other point along the way to flip as well. I don't have to choose that path but since it's part of the possible loops for many given point, it's part of its holonomy group. If I decide to choose that path, then that loop cannot be shrunk to a point unless I never left the point I was standing on and I only did an inversion. Any other rotation followed by a jump results in an unshrinkable loop with respect to the starting point on the surface of the sphere. Is this accurate?

When understanding RPN as topologically equivalent to SN with antipodal points identified, what is the map that is necessary to make them actually equivalent? I want to relate this to quotient space and the point at infinity in projective space.

I feel like I miss something profound with relation to non-trivial loops resulting in phase shifts. Something in the vicinity of this I think will help me grasp spinors more. I feel like I might understand but I'm need more.

In a random reading yesterday, a piecewise function for polynomials mentioned the use of double knots to tie lines together and triple knots to create an endpoint, what's that about?

What is a world sheet? I think I understand it as a two-dimensional flexing sheet that matches the orientation of the string possibly pulsing on its own tangent space according to the vibrations.

Explain what a quantum scar is more. It sounds similar to the effect where the phase shifts by a negative one even though we're just orbiting a magnetic flux and not actually passing through it. Is this a phenomena also induced by collecting topological charges through periodic orbits and similar?

Is a three-sphere topologically identical to a sphere in three-dimensional space or is there a something different about it because it's embedded in 4D? I get the sense that it's exactly the same as adding a fourth spatial coordinate to an existing sphere and adjusting all other coordinates so that the combined magnitude of all four components is 1. Does it still look like a sphere in 3-space?

For RP3, does the identification of antipodal points mean that only positive outcomes are considered in the domain? By this I mean that mapping the full upper half of the sphere is enough to also map the lower half due to the identification.

If TQFTs are entirely topological, does that mean that all of their features are entirely composed of nothing but knots? Aside from a knots what other kinds of topological features can exist?

Are the knots of piecewise polynomial functions connected to the knots of topology? Why is a double knot a discontinuity in the first derivative and then a triple not a discontinuity in the first two derivatives? Presumably it keeps going from there?

In the ADS/CFT correspondence is the world sheet the boundary that the conformal theory exists on? I know the correspondence isn't specifically for string theory but would that be the implication of that correspondence?

When you say that the quantum scar retains. The city from the classic scale when it otherwise would be non-local In the context of a topological insulator is the surface boundary the protected feature or is it the edge states or corner states or something else? Are these states maintained by the global shape of the material or something else?

I envision a three sphere as a regular sphere that grows from nothing to infinite size like shells, much in the way that a sphere can be defined from unit circles of infinitismal size to some unit size and back. Is this an accurate understanding of that space? Perhaps with a origin that is anywhere I "look", if I was trying to see it from R3?

For RP3, does the identification of antipodal points mean that only positive outcomes are necessary because all opposite points are implied, and thus the space is half the size of S3? By this I mean that mapping the full upper half of the 3-sphere is enough to also map the lower half due to the identification.

If TQFTs are entirely topological, does that mean that all of their features are entirely composed of knots? Aside from a knots what other kinds of topological features can exist?

My understanding of the world sheet is the two-dimensional surface traced out by a string as it's dragged through time. Are there any renditions of string theory where the string itself wraps around the entire universe and back, essentially forming one of many dense lines composing an originless RP3?

Are the knots of piecewise polynomial functions connected to the knots of topology? Why is a double knot a discontinuity in the first derivative and then a triple not a discontinuity in the first two derivatives? Presumably it keeps going from there?

Is it accurate to say then that S3 is like a normal sphere in R3 continuously packed from North Pole to South Pole with progressively larger spheres until the entire space is filled and you have a ball?

So is this related to fibers in manifolds we talked about earlier with relation to gauge theories, but instead of tensor connections between manifolds defined by curved gauge theories, each point in S2 hosts a tangent fiber that is itself an S1?

You said that the S1 pre-images are interlinked with each other in such a way that they cannot be broken, is this a complex relationship or what is the nature of this? Could this be considered infinitismal complex unit circles embedded within S2 and oriented with the ambient space and the origin?

Previous two questions precede your torii description, are the torii linked in a chainlink fence kind of way and then shrunk down to the surface points of S2? Is there an actual twist in the way that I'm suggesting with chain link fences? I'm visualizing the torus of one point looping through the null space of its adjacent point.

Consider all my questions about S3. My goal is to develop a deep understanding of the hopf fibration at an intuitive level where I can visualize it with ease. I feel like I'm pretty close but I need to understand the nature of the embedded S1 spaces and how they interlink and how they manifest beyond the point they are embedded in.

I didn't understand the bit about every S1 that's embedded is not actually in a point on S2 but rather distributed across the entire surface of the S2. By this do you mean that every S1, a point on the S2 base space, is itself a great circle wrapping the entire S2?

You said that any two fibers are linked, by this do you mean literally any two points picked at random on the S2 are essentially linked by a transformation on an embedded S1?

Is S3 considered to be torsion-free? If each fiber on the S2 space smoothly transitions into the next fiber or any other fiber, does that mean in the fiber space they are already connected?

Okay it sounds like maybe each S1 is not actually distributed across the entire surface of the S2 but like you said it's a almost like a knitting on the surface? If I envision each S1 as a sort of Mobius strip it makes sense to me how they can be shrunk and then embedded into S2, and the twisting there is from the projection from 4D, they're not actually twisted in 4D. I definitely understand how you could project a unit circle onto a unit sphere but I don't see a way to do that projection that results in a single unit circle covering an entire surface of a sphere.

Oh okay maybe I understand now. Is it reasonable to say that every point in the embedded 1-sphere is touching a different adjacent 1-sphere? In this sense after you choose an arbitrary point on the 2-sphere, every single direction from 0-tau radians is associated with a tangent connection to another one sphere by definition, since you would be moving to a different point on the 2-sphere.

Explain the block sphere more. I think I get this in the sense of combining a block and a sphere obviously, more likely a spinor, but it's not clear to me what exactly this might mean.

I still don't quite understand how every point on S2 could possibly be connected to every other point in a smooth way, if only because it would require a denser set of points in S1 I think in order to reach all the other points in S2 by virtue of the area of S2. I also don't understand it in terms of homotopy because it seems like you would be able to skip around anywhere you wanted on S2 and that wouldn't be smooth. But maybe in 4D space these actions that look like skipping across the bulk of the sphere is fine?

To be clear, the parameter space is the additional fiber space on top of the base manifold right, and not the base manifold itself? I didn't quite catch from who's perspective we're coming from.

Okay this is what I meant about simple connectingness of a line segment. A line segment is a zero sphere. Why doesn't this apply to a normal unit circle or 1-sphere? Is it because the connection between any two points is nonlinear, which is different from a line segment or zero sphere?

Each fiber representing an orbit makes a lot of sense to me. Then every point starts and terminates on the surface of the two sphere, right along with its orbit and fiber. This also makes sense to me with respect to antipodal points because unlike projective space which identifies the antipodal point as the same point, this would be two distinct orbits that are topologically inverted. Is this characterization correct?

Assuming the above is somewhat close, then from any given point on S2 base space, a single orbit is S1, but the space of possible orbits from that point still seems to be S2-like (starting from the North Pole for example, performing an orbit in every possible direction would cover the entire 2-sphere). Are all of these possible directions still part of the same embedded S1, or is each possible direction a different S1 and a different great circle threading?

Oh I see so when you said orbit earlier you meant from a given point in the S2 base space, the S1 that's embedded represents a unique 360 orbit you can make from that point. As you move around the surface of S2 and the embedded S1 rings, you smoothly interpolate from all possible orientations or rotations, which is exactly why it's the set of unit quaternions. Is that correct?

Okay then we probably miscommunicated earlier because I do think this S1, as it's shrunk to a point, would essentially be in a "tangent" plane to the S2 norm, hovering right "above" the S2 point, and linked with every single S1 point around it by "touching" (the geodesic path to the adjacent point in S2 and a different S1 fiber) in a single tangent point, but it's infinitismally small because it's being projected from 4D and you're only seeing it's shadow as a single point. Does this seem reasonable now? Each tangent plane and embedded S1 represents a different possible 360 rotation orbit orientation from any given origin point in R3? I think this would essentially look like infinitismal chainmail over S2.

Okay just to be clear, because I'm still not quite sure, so I'll try to ask a question that will hopefully clear it up for me. If I understand correctly, S3 is simply connected, so any loop can be reduced back to a point. If I'm on the surface of S3, say at the North Pole of its S2 embedding, what is the neighborhood of that point? Is the neighborhood of that point still all the obvious points in S2 since that is the base space? And does the North Pole fiber only interlink with its neighborhood or does it interlink with every single other S1 fiber that exists on the entire surface?

You're saying is the chainmail analogy is pretty close and if you were to project the interlocked rings on the surface of the two sphere in the way I was describing down into the bulk of the two sphere, it might look like that first visualization, assuming every single point on the two sphere got its own color? The projection distorts each circle into the bulk and they blend together in the way the image shows?

Oh wow I think that might have done it. I get it now possibly. There's no need to pass through the surface of S2 at all because for every possible rotation, there's a unique great circle S1 rotation that will take me from point A to point B. It almost seems like a dense star type configuration. I was thinking you had to pass through a network of points to get somewhere else on S2 but that was a misconception on my part it sounds like, and just like the surprising differences between S1 and S2, S3 sort of miraculously gains the ability to link every point together on the surface of S2 smoothly and simultaneously. Does this sound right? Identify where it's still wrong If so.

Related to the above, you mentioned this universal linking means any given S1 can be smoothly transformed into any other S1. Clarify what you meant about smoothing here and transformed and the exact kind of transformation that would happen from say a 90° turn on any given axis

Okay I think I get it from the abstract point of view for the most part now, maybe, but I want to reconcile a few lingering questions I had, specifically about the fact that different rotations are of different magnitude. Probably I'm trying to get a feel for how quaternions would be distributed across this S2, such as if smaller rotations or other categories of rotations cluster together in different regions on the base space

I think maybe the best visualization after all this discussion for S3 would be a hollow, multicolored ball of yarn, 🧶 that is typically built up using great circles of sorts, and you could think of each color as being an independent axis with a corresponding great circle
